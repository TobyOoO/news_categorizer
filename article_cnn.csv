Bush.</p>  <p>Calls for the Republican-led House to impeach Obama are coming from Sarah Palin and other harsh conservative critics at the height of midterm campaigning. His administration's handling of the immigration crisis on the southern border has amplified the small chorus.</p>  <p>However, such a step is considered far-fetched, especially after House Speaker John Boehner expressed disagreement with the premise in this case.</p>  <p>Obama has clashed repeatedly and sharply with Republicans during his presidency.</p>  <p>Cheney, however, did offer limited support for House Republican efforts to sue Obama over their claims he has abused his authority on a number of occasions by unlawfully going around Congress to carry out policy.</p>  <p>They're focusing their unusual legal action on a piece of Obamacare, a major political flashpoint between the GOP and the President and his supporters.</p>  <p>""I'm glad to see the House Republicans are challenging him at least legally at this point.

We defeated al Qaeda, we had a coalition government in place,"" he added.</p>  <p>Asked whether some of the decisions made by him and Bush are responsible for the upheaval in Iraq now, Cheney deflected blame.</p>  <p>""I think it's primarily Maliki, and Obama.

After a pause, he elaborated. ""That's basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.""</p>  <p>Rand Paul: 'I am not opposed to birth control'</p>  <p>Next question.</p>  <p>The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus -- a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda. And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him: burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesn't stray so far from the Republican line that he won't be able to win the party's presidential nomination.</p>  <p>Another student here pressed him on ""the drug war,"" asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He said he wasn't supportive of drug use, explaining that pot ""is not that great,"" but said drug laws should be left up to states. Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana, he said, and we should be watching carefully.</p>  <p>Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit.</p>  <p>His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal.</p>  <p>""Rand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places,"" the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March.</p>  <p>Paul, reared in libertarian politics, found support there because he railed against the National Security Administration's invasive surveillance operations, calling them an absurd violation of privacy. It's his go-to topic when he talks to young people.</p>  <p>Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones.</p>  <p>Soon after, he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee. Paul and his wife, Kelley, danced and sang along to Chumbawamba, the 90s-era pop band with an anarchist streak.</p>  <p>We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of ""Hambycast.""</p>  <p>After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people — as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party.</p>  <p>On the topic of drugs, I picked up where the student left off, wondering if Paul, as president, would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin. He hedged.</p>  <p>""My position has not been for legalization, my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this, and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance,"" he said.</p>  <p>Then I asked about same-sex marriage, something Paul did not touch on in his remarks. Almost 80% of people under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. It's hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with America's youth. And it's not just teenaged and 20-somethings: A clear majority of Americans, 55%, support same-sex marriage.</p>  <p>Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws.</p>  <p>""I don't want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage,"" he told me. ""Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. It is a local issue and always has been.""</p>  <p>But can Republicans win a national election if they aren't in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter? He took a soft tone.</p>  <p>""Society's changing,"" he said. ""I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they're like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it's been rethought. The President's rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.""</p>  <p>It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage.</p>  <p>""The bottom line is, I'm old fashioned, I'm a traditionalist,"" he said. ""I believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don't really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue.""</p>  <p>""You could rethink it at some point, too?"" I asked him.</p>  <p>He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn't a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul's complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.</p> "

But he came out of retirement six years ago and rode a GOP wave back into office. If voters return him to office this fall, the 67-year-old will have served over 20 years as governor, making him the longest-serving executive in American history.</p>  <p>One reason for Branstad's winning streak is that he's much more of a hardball politician than his aw-shucks Midwestern demeanor suggests. Earlier this year, Branstad, the definition of an establishment Republican, successfully deployed his political machine in an effort to reclaim the Iowa GOP from the clutches of tea party leadership.</p>  <p>So far this year, in his race against Democrat Jack Hatch, he's been able to weather administration scandals and accusations of corruption. One Democrat told me that for Iowa voters, Branstad is ""like an old sweater"" — just the comfortable choice.</p>  <p>Obamadale: The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats?</p>  <p>Branstad was talking about his whiskers while giving me a private tour of the picturesque Iowa state capital for the latest episode of ""Hambycast,"" showing off the knick-knacks and ceremonial gifts that decorate his hideaway office, normally off-limits to reporters.</p>  <p>He pointed proudly to his hunting trophies, a photo with Pope John Paul II, and an Iowa Hawkeyes football jersey with ""BRANSTAD"" emblazoned on the back. Upstairs in the state capitol, we examined baseballs signed by players who had jogged the bases at Field of Dreams in Dyersville. Then we were guided up to the very top of the gilded state capitol for a stunning autumn view of downtown Des Moines.</p>  <p>As the talk turned to 2016 and the looming parade of Republican presidential contenders set to march through Iowa, Branstad brushed off criticism that the caucuses favor uncompromising social conservatives over more moderate Republicans.</p>  <p>Hambycast: Hillary Clinton's madcap media mob</p>  <p>He has a point. Mitt Romney, not exactly a favorite son of the Christian right, almost won the caucuses. There's a sizable pool of mainstream Republicans here waiting to be courted, and in a crowded presidential field, a candidate can win the state with a plurality — and without unified support from social conservatives.</p>  <p>""You need to come here early and often,"" Branstad said, invoking the example of Rick Santorum, who came out of nowhere to win Iowa after campaigning in the state's 99 counties (and, it should be noted, after wearing his conservative Catholic faith on his sleeve).</p>  <p>Branstad would not say if he would endorse a candidate but said he's favorable to Republican governors — no surprise there — a comment that should warm the hearts of Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Mike Pence.</p>  <p>Jeb Bush heading to 2016 primary state</p>  <p>As for the (in)famous Ames Straw Poll, that media-saturated, oft-criticized and nonbinding summertime test of candidate support, Branstad backed away from previous suggestions that the fundraiser should be scrapped.</p>  <p>I asked him if the GOP-run Straw Poll will actually happen next summer in the run-up to the caucuses. Branstad said maybe, but floated another option.</p>  <p>""It's going to depend on the candidates and who is willing to participate,"" he said. ""I think having a series of fundraisers regionally around the state would be a good alternative.""</p> "
"4","Hillary Clinton's madcap media mob","CNN.com","2014-09-23 15:12:16","2014-10-05 02:09:01","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/politics/hambycast-iowa-hillary-clinton/index.html","Politics"," <p>She's done a national book tour and the paid lecture circuit, but Clinton got an up-close look at today's frenzied political news environment last weekend when she visited Iowa for the first time in seven years, a spectacle primed for an avalanche of media coverage given her expected campaign and her tortured history with the Hawkeye State.</p>  <p>I joined more than 200 other reporters who swarmed the scene and tweeted away, even though most Americans on social media that day probably cared more about Robert Griffin's ankle.</p>  <p>The press scrum that assembled to witness noncandidates Hillary and Bill Clinton flip Hy-Vee steaks with Sen. Tom Harkin -- behind a barricade, of course -- was as large, if not larger, than the media hordes that covered her at the height of her 2008 campaign.</p>  <p>One reporter got whacked in the head with the butt of a big television camera. Another photographer dramatically toppled off his ladder while straining to get a shot. It was a little absurd. When the Clintons approached the media zoo for question time, Bill Clinton leaned in and relished the scene. Hillary kept her distance.</p>  <p>Political Twitter, though, wasn't just a stream of gauzy Instagram-filtered pics of the Clintons: It was also rife with media criticism, some fair and some not, from politicos and press critics who pointed to the event as another example of lazy ""pack journalism"" with little journalistic upside.</p>  <p>The sniping had some credibility. What was the competitive advantage of being there, just one more reporter among the herd, all of us racing around to get the same quotes and the same pictures?</p>  <p>This was especially true for the many journalists in attendance who rarely travel outside of Washington or New York to cover politics but decided to open up their travel budget for this one trip.</p>  <p>Couldn't their time have been better spent reporting on an undercovered Senate or governor's race in some other part of the country, far away from the rest of the media scrum? Of course, the academics would say. But the incentive structure of today's click-driven news economy begs to differ. Hillary gets eyeballs. Arkansas' Tom Cotton does not. This is the world we live in.</p>  <p>As much as I believe in straying far, far away from the rest of the media pack -- this was a lynchpin argument in "" Did Twitter Kill The Boys on the Bus? ,"" the Harvard Kennedy School study I wrote last year about the hyperactive political news media -- I did find value in covering the Steak Fry.</p>  <p>For one, I lived Clinton's 2008 campaign up close as an embedded producer for CNN, living on her campaign plane for six months and ingesting every single stump speech, gaffe and gross turkey sandwich in front of me. It was useful for me to see whether her political skills and her willingness to play the Iowa game had shifted since she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama.</p>  <p>The whole thing was broadcast on CNN and C-SPAN, which is fine and good, but television cameras don't pick up the small things reporters can sniff on the ground: The receptiveness of the crowd, the impressive organizational prowess of the once-meager Ready for Hillary super PAC, the absurdity of the staged photo-ops and press scrums, and the rope-line body language of Clinton herself, which was noticeably more cautious than her husband Bill (some things never change).</p>  <p>Those are the kind of atmospherics I chose to focus on when crafting my report from the scene as well as this week's episode of Hambycast.</p>  <p>And of course, there's the reporting that went on nowhere near the Steak Fry, those meetings with Democrat and Republican sources in and around Des Moines. Was all that worth the plane ticket to DSM? Definitely. Will I go somewhere where other reporters aren't for my next trip? You bet.</p>  <p>Watching the Iowa theatrics from afar, the journalist Dave Weigel wrote that Hillary's protocandidacy is a ""problem for the media, which simultaneously is ready right now to cover her like a nominee -- 200 reporters! -- and yet so palpably bored with how she talks, and runs.""</p>  <p>But the ever-growing press corps, weaponized by Twitter , will also be a problem for Clinton and her team, who must find ways of engaging with a massive entourage of reporters that is constantly on the hunt for ""news"" -- i.e., anything off-message or click-worthy -- while also trying to drive the conversation on their own terms.</p>  <p>The hyperguarded Mitt Romney encountered this same dilemma during his ill-fated 2012 presidential bid.</p>  <p>Watch more Hambycasts</p>  <p>When he avoided the press, he got punished by a cranky and access-starved press corps. When he held a rare press conference to push a policy idea, his comments were drowned out by a cacophony of horse-race questions or some Twitter-driven ""controversy"" unfolding hundreds of miles away.</p>  <p>So he chose to get his message out on his own terms, through paid media or friendly Fox News interviews, without the filter of the ""traditional"" press, whatever that means. In the end, it wasn't enough.</p>  <p>That political reporters are motivated by conflict, personality and the ups-and-downs of a campaign is nothing new , and it's unlikely to change despite carping from media critics.</p>  <p>What has changed is the atomized and hyperactive social news environment we all live in now, and it's changed dramatically since Clinton last announced a presidential bid in 2007, before the iPhone existed and well before Twitter took hold among the political class.</p>  <p>If she runs again, there will be reporters covering her campaign who were barely in diapers when Bill Clinton was elected President, who came of age in an era of Internet journalism that prizes exclusives and micronews, who have very different incentives than the television and newspaper reporters that the Clintons dealt with during his presidency or her last campaign. They hold the Clintons in high-regard, but not nearly as high as the regard the Clintons have for themselves.</p>  <p>Hillary got a taste of this during her book tour -- her de-facto re-entry into political life -- when various comments that had even a whiff of controversy or gaffe-status rocketed across the Internet at warp speed, with an assist from Republican opposition researchers.</p>  <p>Life as a candidate, of course, is something much different. Clinton knows this. But her Iowa pop-in was her first glimpse of the thorny new reality that awaits.</p> "

And his political future could hinge on whether the first-term Republican can convince conservatives that he's not just rebranding Obamacare.</p>  <p>Pence has spent much of his first two years in office trying to strike a bargain on one of the health care law's core components. Indiana will expand Medicaid coverage, Pence says, but only if it's allowed to do it through a tweaked version called the ""Healthy Indiana Plan,"" which also requires users to make small payments into health savings accounts.</p>  <p>He spent five minutes chatting with Obama at the Evansville airport, lobbying to have the Health and Human Services Department green-light Indiana's request, before the president visited a factory in Princeton, Indiana.</p>  <p>""The president and I talked through a number of substantive issues that have arisen in our discussions over the Healthy Indiana Plan,"" Pence said afterward, ""and I appreciated the opportunity to call the matter to his personal attention.""</p>  <p>He said he also spoke last night with top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, and will meet Monday with HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.</p>  <p>Pence's focus on a health care expansion is at the center of his effort to evolve from a firebrand conservative congressman to an executive with a record of accomplishment ahead of a White House run that many Republicans close to him see as a question of when -- not if.</p>  <p>As he flirts with a 2016 bid, Pence could be the best test of whether a conservative can run nationally after expanding a government-sponsored health system. Mitt Romney faced hurdles with conservatives during his 2012 presidential bid, in part because of the health care system he put in place when he was the governor of Massachusetts.</p>  <p>Other governors who could seek the 2016 GOP nomination -- including New Jersey's Chris Christie and Ohio's John Kasich -- have accepted Obamacare's extension of Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of their state's residents.</p>  <p>But Pence has taken an important extra step. He's arguing that Indiana's proposal is the solution to Medicaid's woes. He called Indiana's plan ""a better and more effective alternative"" to traditional Medicaid in a letter to Obama on Thursday.</p>  <p>The Healthy Indiana Plan's key departure from traditional Medicaid is that users are required to contribute small amounts of their own money to personal health savings accounts. The program was developed under former Gov. Mitch Daniels and initially served about 40,000 adults under a Medicaid waiver that HHS granted before Obamacare's existence. After Pence was elected in 2012, he said a slightly updated version called the ""Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0"" is the only vehicle he'd consider for expanding coverage.</p>  <p>""Since its inception, the Healthy Indiana Plan has empowered its members to take greater personal ownership over their health care decisions and become more cost-conscious consumers of health care services,"" Pence wrote to Obama on Thursday.</p>  <p>But some conservatives say Indiana's changes to Medicaid are just ""window dressing.""</p>  <p>""It seems like he's just sort of taken the moniker of health savings accounts and applied it to this brand new entitlement in hoping that this window dressing will make it conservative,"" said Jonathan Ingram, the research director for the Foundation for Government Accountability, which has set up a website -- StopPence.com -- blasting Pence's handling of the issue.</p>  <p>Even Pence's usually-reliable allies have been critical. Chase Downham, Americans for Prosperity's Indiana state director, called it a ""troubling deviation from the solid, free-market approach Gov. Pence has taken on most other matters,"" and said he hopes Pence is firm with Obama to keep from giving ""any ground which would result in Hoosier taxpayers paying even more.""</p>  <p>The criticism comes as Pence is increasingly hyped as a prospective nominee who both the GOP's base and its business wing could find acceptable.</p>  <p>A 2016 run is no lock, and Pence has said he'll make a decision about his future next year -- likely after the Indiana legislature wraps up its budget-writing session in April.</p>  <p>But he's been testing the waters. Pence visited Iowa last month and will campaign in New Hampshire for Gov. Walt Havenstein on Oct. 24. He critiqued Obama's handling of foreign policy during a trip to Germany over the summer.</p>  <p>And two of his former top aides, Marc Short and Matt Lloyd, now work within the network of conservative funding giants Charles and David Koch -- a sign that Pence would have the financial backing for a national run.</p>  <p>Ingram said his group polled three early primary states -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- in August, and found that 70 percent of likely GOP primary voters said they wouldn't support a candidate who had expanded Medicaid.</p>  <p>""The idea that a Republican governor can come in and implement Obamacare and then run for president unscathed -- it seems a little ridiculous,"" he said.</p> "

""But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.""</p>  <p>Rep. Cory Gardner, the Republican nominee for Senate in Colorado, already played up the line during an interview Friday.</p>  <p>""Well I think the President himself yesterday stated that his policies are going to be on the ballot,"" he said.

While it's unlikely Romney will run, he's leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign. Meanwhile, of course, everyone is watching Clinton for signs that she might join the race -- and she's doing little to discourage the attention.</p>  <p>The 2016 contest is far from a lock. But if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president, would there be any surprises?</p>  <p>Luckily, with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view, we have an idea of what a Romney-Clinton match up might look like. Here are some areas that would be interesting to watch:</p>  <p>Russia</p>  <p>Critics have faulted Clinton for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia. As secretary, Clinton famously offered her Russian counterpart a ""reset"" button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more.</p>  <p>But President Putin's incursion into Ukraine and his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country's bloody civil war, both of which occurred after Clinton stepped down, have chilled the relationship Clinton hoped would thaw.</p>  <p>Enter Romney, who was mocked after calling Russia the United States' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during an interview with CNN in 2012. At the time, Clinton called his remarks ""dated.""</p>  <p>Romney struck back in an interview with Fox this summer, calling Clinton's reset button ""one of the most embarrassing incidents in American foreign policy.""</p>  <p>Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton's 2008 effort, underlined the former secretary of state's real world foreign policy experience.</p>  <p>""As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a foreign policy record,"" Sefl said. ""I'm not entirely sure what Mitt Romney has besides campaign positions.""</p>  <p>What about gaffes?</p>  <p>Romney famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that Democrats used to paint him as out-of-touch.</p>  <p>From the ""couple of Cadillacs"" he said his wife owned, to the 47 percent of Americans he said were dependent on government, to his offhand remark that ""I like being able to fire people"" who provide bad service, Romney handed opponents an opening.</p>  <p>But while promoting her book ""Hard Choices"" this summer, Clinton made some missteps of her own. The former first lady said she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001. Earlier this year, she told an audience in New Orleans that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of Secret Service concerns.</p>  <p>Were Romney to run again, Clinton's stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns.</p>  <p>A former Romney aide suggested Romney's more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump.</p>  <p>""She's rusty,"" former Romney 2012 spokesman Ryan Williams said of Clinton. ""Gov. Romney has been through two campaigns at this point. He's been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates. She certainly would have a steeper learning curve.""</p>  <p>Clinton has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups. But she hasn't crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like Romney.</p>  <p>That potential advantage could extend to presidential debates. Romney shot up in the polls after surprising President Obama in their first one-on-one debate in October 2012. Clinton hasn't gone through that grueling experience since 2008.</p>  <p>But CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said Romney would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he doesn't understand them.</p>  <p>""It was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant. I still think that's there,"" Brownstein said. ""I don't think Romney gets away from that no matter who he's running against.""</p>  <p>Women</p>  <p>In 2008, Clinton's presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" She continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the State Department and through her family's philanthropic arm, the Clinton Foundation.</p>  <p>Romney struggled with women voters in 2012, with 55% of women supporting President Obama. Clinton has the potential to grow Democratic support even among women who supported Romney during the last election.</p>  <p>""She is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the Republican Party,"" Brownstein said, pointing to GOP support for the Hobby Lobby case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for Planned Parenthood programs.</p>  <p>Clinton supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare, saying those issues have already resonated with voters.</p>  <p>""I fail to see anyone in the GOP that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as Hillary does today,"" Sefl said.</p>  <p>Message</p>  <p>Recent public remarks from Romney and Clinton give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign.</p>  <p>Clinton has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events, in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme.</p>  <p>""Don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing here today as women's work,"" Clinton told an audience at the Democratic Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. in September. ""We're here proud Democratic women and proud Democratic men, to stand up not just ourselves, not just for women but for all our people - for our families, our communities and our country.""</p>  <p>Clinton also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super PAC Ready For Hillary that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy.</p>  <p>As for Romney, his message could be something like: ""having second (or third) thoughts now?"" On that theme, he told an audience in Colorado this week that President Obama should have taken the terrorist group ISIS more seriously earlier.</p>  <p>""For the president to say, 'Gee, we underestimated ISIS' suggests he wasn't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,"" Romney said. ""I guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations, golf, fundraising. He just hasn't done the job he promised to do.""</p>  <p>A CNN/ORC poll from July found that 53% of Americans would support Romney over President Obama if they could vote again today. (In a hypothetical match up with Clinton, however, 55% would have supported Clinton, with 42% for Romney.)</p>  <p>Romney supporters argue the former candidate seemed prescient on a variety of issues.</p>  <p>""He brings a proven track record of being forward thinking and having the ability to recognize problems and threats before they become a disaster,"" Williams, his former spokesman, said.</p>  <p>But while the upcoming presidential election may center on change, both Clinton and Romney could find themselves talking a lot about their experience.</p>  <p>""You've also got to have people who've actually run something,"" Romney told Fox News in September. ""I don't think Hillary Clinton has that experience.""</p> "

So why is the President saying now his intelligence agencies misjudged the terror group, currently being pummeled by U.S. and coalition airstrikes?</p>  <p>In an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Obama admitted the U.S. ""underestimated what had been taking place in Syria"" that allowed the country to become ""ground zero for jihadists around the world.""</p>  <p>He cited his director of national intelligence James Clapper, who told the Washington Post in mid-September the U.S. ""underestimated ISIL [the government's name for ISIS] and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army.""</p>  <p>CNN exclusive: ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes aren't effective</p>  <p>Those remarks echoed Obama's own statement from early August, when he told reporters ""intelligence estimates"" hadn't accurately predicted ISIS' advances through Iraq and Syria.</p>  <p>In remarks and testimony, however, U.S. officials have been warning of ISIS' rise going back more than a year -- while at the same time warning of the limited intelligence-gathering capacity inside the countries where ISIS was expanding.</p>  <p>Obama subtly pushes back against Clinton, Panetta on Syria</p>  <p>The warnings extend as far back as July 2013, when David Shedd, then acting as deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told a conference that al Qaeda-affiliated groups were gaining strength in Syria.</p>  <p>""It is very clear over the last two years they have grown in size, grown in capability and ruthlessly grown in effectiveness,"" he said at a CNN-sponsored panel at the Aspen Security Forum. ""They will not go home when it is over. They will fight for that space. They are there for the long haul.""</p>  <p>Since then, officials have warned that ISIS wasn't going anywhere -- including in October, when a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call that the danger from ISIS was intensifying.</p>  <p>""This is really a major and increasing threat to Iraq's stability ... and it's an increasing threat to us,"" said the official, who was previewing a visit to Washington by then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki.</p>  <p>Next step: Keeping anti-ISIS coalition together</p>  <p>The warning had ramped up by February, when the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency told lawmakers ISIS was looking to gain ground.</p>  <p>""[Al Qaeda in Iraq/ISIL] probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014, as demonstrated recently in Ramadi and Fallujah, and the group's ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria,"" Mike Flynn wrote in prepared testimony for the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>  <p>The terror groups, Flynn wrote, had ""exploited the permissive security environment to increase its operations and presence in many locations and also has expanded into Syria and Lebanon to inflame tensions throughout the region.""</p>  <p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama wasn't blaming his intelligence services when he said they ""underestimated"" ISIS.</p>  <p>""The way that I would describe it is that everybody did; that everybody was surprised to see the rapid advance that ISIL was able to make from Syria across the Iraqi border and to be able to take over such large swaths of territory in Iraq did come as a surprise,"" Earnest said.</p>  <p>He added it was also difficult to assess ahead of time how well Iraqi security forces would be able to defend their own country because of the sectarian divisions in Iraq's government. He admitted there was some doubt that the forces would fend off ISIS's incursions.</p>  <p>""And I think that proved to be true in the end that ISIL was able to make significant gains because of the Iraqi security forces weren't able to withstand their advance,"" Earnest said.</p> "

Count House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, as one of those people.</p>  <p>Boehner said Sunday it may take U.S. boots on the ground to defeat ISIS, as he questioned President Barack Obama's plan -- which includes airstrikes, training and equipping the Iraqi Army and moderate Syrian rebels -- to defeat the terrorist network.</p>  <p>""Listen, the President doesn't want to do that,"" Boehner said in an interview on ABC's ""This Week."" ""If I were the President, I probably wouldn't have talked about what I wouldn't do. And maybe, maybe we can get enough of these forces trained and get them on the battlefield, but somebody's boots have to be there.""</p>  <p>Boehner later added that the United States might have ""no choice"" but to put U.S. soldiers on the ground. ""These are barbarians,"" Boehner said of ISIS in the ABC interview. ""They intend to kill us, and if we don't destroy them first, we're going to pay the price.""</p>  <p>But Obama, in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, continued to emphasize that U.S. combat troops will not be put on the ground, saying that the situation in the region is not a military problem, rather a political problem that leaders of those countries -- specifically Iraq -- need to address.</p>  <p>""This is not America against ISIL,"" Obama said in the interview that aired on '60 Minutes.'"" This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with, to make sure that they -- are able to take care of their business.""</p>  <p>Even though Obama has said he will not place combat troops in the region, the United States does have military advisers on the ground training and helping the Iraqi army strategically as it battle ISIS.</p>  <p>ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes aren't effective</p>  <p>The formation of the international coalition of countries working with the United States to destroy ISIS is what appears to be giving Obama a boost of support from the American public for military action against ISIS. Seventy-three percent of Americans back the joint U.S. and ally airstrikes, but support drops to 50% if the mission had been undertaken solely by the United States.</p>  <p>Americans have a weary eye about one piece of the plan to defeat ISIS: arming the moderate Syrian rebels. While Congress approved legislation before it left for the campaign trail to allow for the arming and training of the rebels, only 42% of Americans favor this action, and 54% oppose it.</p>  <p>Still, there is an undeniable belief among Americans that ISIS poses some level of threat to the United States, with 45% describing it as ""very serious,"" 23% saying it is ""fairly serious"" and 23% noting that it is ""somewhat serious.""</p>  <p>Since the President addressed the nation on September 10 to outline his plan to defeat ISIS, Americans appear more confident in his ability to address the situation. A CNN/ORC poll conducted before his speech showed that 37% of Americans approved of how he was handling ISIS, but this number has now increased to 45%. Overall, 46% of Americans approve of how he is handling the general topic of terrorism, up five points from the CNN/ORC poll conducted earlier this month.</p>  <p>Overall, the President's approval rating remains constant from the previous CNN/ORC poll. Earlier this month, 43% of Americans approved of how he was handling his job, while the new CNN/ORC poll shows that it ticked up one point to 44%.</p>  <p>Keating Holland, CNN's polling director, notes that only 40% of Americans believe the United States is at war with ISIS, which ""may explain why ... his job rating doesn't reflect a 'rally effect' that previous presidents have experienced during wartime.""</p>  <p>In terms of the general mood of the country, 50% of Americans say things are going well, while 49% say it is going badly.</p>  <p>On the five major general themes, Obama rates under 50%: terrorism, 46%; ISIS, 45%; foreign affairs, 42%; economy, 42%; health care 42% -- more signs that Obama could be more hurtful than helpful to vulnerable Democrats seeking reelection in November.</p>  <p>The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International, which interviewed 1,055 adult Americans, by telephone between September 25 and September 28.

While it's unlikely Romney will run, he's leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign. Meanwhile, of course, everyone is watching Clinton for signs that she might join the race -- and she's doing little to discourage the attention.</p>  <p>The 2016 contest is far from a lock. But if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president, would there be any surprises?</p>  <p>Luckily, with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view, we have an idea of what a Romney-Clinton match up might look like. Here are some areas that would be interesting to watch:</p>  <p>Russia</p>  <p>Critics have faulted Clinton for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia. As secretary, Clinton famously offered her Russian counterpart a ""reset"" button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more.</p>  <p>But President Putin's incursion into Ukraine and his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country's bloody civil war, both of which occurred after Clinton stepped down, have chilled the relationship Clinton hoped would thaw.</p>  <p>Enter Romney, who was mocked after calling Russia the United States' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during an interview with CNN in 2012. At the time, Clinton called his remarks ""dated.""</p>  <p>Romney struck back in an interview with Fox this summer, calling Clinton's reset button ""one of the most embarrassing incidents in American foreign policy.""</p>  <p>Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton's 2008 effort, underlined the former secretary of state's real world foreign policy experience.</p>  <p>""As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a foreign policy record,"" Sefl said. ""I'm not entirely sure what Mitt Romney has besides campaign positions.""</p>  <p>What about gaffes?</p>  <p>Romney famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that Democrats used to paint him as out-of-touch.</p>  <p>From the ""couple of Cadillacs"" he said his wife owned, to the 47 percent of Americans he said were dependent on government, to his offhand remark that ""I like being able to fire people"" who provide bad service, Romney handed opponents an opening.</p>  <p>But while promoting her book ""Hard Choices"" this summer, Clinton made some missteps of her own. The former first lady said she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001. Earlier this year, she told an audience in New Orleans that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of Secret Service concerns.</p>  <p>Were Romney to run again, Clinton's stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns.</p>  <p>A former Romney aide suggested Romney's more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump.</p>  <p>""She's rusty,"" former Romney 2012 spokesman Ryan Williams said of Clinton. ""Gov. Romney has been through two campaigns at this point. He's been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates. She certainly would have a steeper learning curve.""</p>  <p>Clinton has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups. But she hasn't crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like Romney.</p>  <p>That potential advantage could extend to presidential debates. Romney shot up in the polls after surprising President Obama in their first one-on-one debate in October 2012. Clinton hasn't gone through that grueling experience since 2008.</p>  <p>But CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said Romney would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he doesn't understand them.</p>  <p>""It was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant. I still think that's there,"" Brownstein said. ""I don't think Romney gets away from that no matter who he's running against.""</p>  <p>Women</p>  <p>In 2008, Clinton's presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" She continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the State Department and through her family's philanthropic arm, the Clinton Foundation.</p>  <p>Romney struggled with women voters in 2012, with 55% of women supporting President Obama. Clinton has the potential to grow Democratic support even among women who supported Romney during the last election.</p>  <p>""She is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the Republican Party,"" Brownstein said, pointing to GOP support for the Hobby Lobby case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for Planned Parenthood programs.</p>  <p>Clinton supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare, saying those issues have already resonated with voters.</p>  <p>""I fail to see anyone in the GOP that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as Hillary does today,"" Sefl said.</p>  <p>Message</p>  <p>Recent public remarks from Romney and Clinton give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign.</p>  <p>Clinton has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events, in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme.</p>  <p>""Don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing here today as women's work,"" Clinton told an audience at the Democratic Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. in September. ""We're here proud Democratic women and proud Democratic men, to stand up not just ourselves, not just for women but for all our people - for our families, our communities and our country.""</p>  <p>Clinton also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super PAC Ready For Hillary that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy.</p>  <p>As for Romney, his message could be something like: ""having second (or third) thoughts now?"" On that theme, he told an audience in Colorado this week that President Obama should have taken the terrorist group ISIS more seriously earlier.</p>  <p>""For the president to say, 'Gee, we underestimated ISIS' suggests he wasn't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,"" Romney said. ""I guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations, golf, fundraising. He just hasn't done the job he promised to do.""</p>  <p>A CNN/ORC poll from July found that 53% of Americans would support Romney over President Obama if they could vote again today.

They're highlighting Obama's recent assurance that Ebola was ""unlikely"" to get to the U.S. and calling for the U.S. to impose new travel restrictions for those countries in Africa where the outbreak began.</p>  <p>It's all part of an effort to force their Democratic opponents to defend Obama's response to Ebola.</p>  <p>GOP officials have reason to believe their line of attack will resonate with voters. CNN has learned from sources at the NRSC, the national campaign organization for Senate Republicans, that the group's internal polling finds 60 percent of voters believe that if a single case of Ebola arises in the U.S., it should be treated as a major crisis by the federal government.</p>  <p>""Washington is broken,"" claimed an NRSC email. ""The top-down approach championed by Democrats for decades (and controlled by them at the federal level in Washington) has shown itself to be completely unprepared and ill-equipped for 21st Century challenges.""</p>  <p>Democrats have been supportive of the administration's efforts, but are pushing for a coordinated effort with other countries to prevent further spread of Ebola. Still, GOP candidates have picked up on the message.</p>  <p>Michigan Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land Friday called for a travel ban or other restrictions to ensure more infected people do not enter the country.</p>  <p>""I'm a mom. I have kids. People are concerned. Again, this is a safety and security issue,"" Land told Michigan Public Radio. She called on the president and her opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters, who she is trailing in most polls, to outline a federal response.</p>  <p>""The President needs to lead,"" Land said. ""Congressman Peters needs to lead -- to come up with a plan to make sure we can deal with this.""</p>  <p>A spokeswoman for Peters told CNN that Land is ""desperate.""</p>  <p>""It is sad Terri Lynn Land is now so desperate that she's trying to use a deadly virus as a political issue, and it's shameful,"" spokeswoman Haley Morris said. ""Before playing politics with such a serious issue, Terri Lynn Land should explain why she pushed for the government shutdown last year, which hampered the CDC and our nation's emergency readiness.""</p>  <p>In North Carolina, Thom Tillis, who is trying to unseat Democrat Kay Hagan in one of the most closely watched Senate races this year, also called for a travel ban from West African countries.</p>  <p>""It's time for Washington to take action to protect the American people,"" said Tillis, who many recent polls show is narrowly trailing Hagan.</p>  <p>A Hagan spokeswoman responded that Tillis's approach would not do enough.</p>  <p>""Kay believes the U.S. should work together with the international community to take a wide range of steps to fight this epidemic and prevent it from spreading,"" Sadie Weiner said in an email. ""Travel restrictions may be one tool we can use, but they should be part of a broader strategy because simply sealing the borders to these countries won't make the crisis go away.""</p>  <p>As far back as August, Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor tried to use the issue of Ebola against his opponent, GOP Rep. Tom Cotton. In a campaign ad, Pryor accused Cotton of voting against a 2013 bill that included money to respond to pandemics. But Cotton did support the final version that became law, according to an analysis by Politifact.</p>  <p>On Friday, Cotton signed a letter to Obama with fellow House Republicans from Arkansas urging him to consider a ban on flights to affected countries.</p>  <p>""The quality of our hospitals, we well as our talented doctors, is undoubtedly a draw for people with the means and will to come to the U.S. -- sometimes because exposure to Ebola in their own country and in spite of the risk to the health of Americans,"" the GOP congressmen wrote.</p>  <p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday that at this point, the Administration is not considering imposing any travel ban.</p>  <p>In an interview on CNN Friday, the number two official with the Senate GOP campaign arm, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, said the U.S. needs to be ""more aggressive"" in screening people coming to the country and pointed to recent report that said the Department of Homeland Security is not equipped right now to deal with a pandemic.</p>  <p>""I don't think we're prepared as we should be,"" Portman said. ""I think this is another example where the administration was not as engaged early on as they should have been and now we're playing catch-up.""</p>  <p>Aides for both the House GOP and Democratic campaign committees tell CNN Ebola has not cropped up in House races at this point. But that could change as political campaigns in recent weeks have been quick to focus their messages on issues that are on voters' minds.</p>  <p>Soon after questions were raised about Obama's response to the terror group ISIS, and public opinion polls showed Americans were increasingly worried about an attack at home, Republican candidates began bringing up the issue.</p>  <p>The National Republicans Congressional Campaign Committee rolled out television commercials suggesting several Democratic candidates didn't support funding to respond to terrorists threats and they were ""dangerous.""</p>  <p>And though Congress is in recess for the final stretch before the midterm elections, a House committee announced on Friday that it will hold a hearing on the Ebola outbreak on Oct. 16.</p> "

Obama had said that it was a fulfillment to his 2008 campaign promise to bring troops in Iraq home. But at the same time, talks to get the Status of Forces Agreement, which provided immunity from prosecution to those troops, were at a standstill due to the internal politics of Iraq.</p>  <p>Panetta, who said he argued behind the scenes and publicly for a small amount of troops to be left for additional training for Iraq's military, was frustrated with White House negotiations on the deal. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy led the administration's efforts in the heated debate.</p>  <p>""Those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests,"" he said in excerpts of the book released by Time Magazine.</p>  <p>He writes that his views were shared by other military commanders in the region and the Joint Chiefs of Staff but he believes that the Commander-in-Chief could have done more.</p>  <p>""Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one, but without the President's active advocacy, al-Maliki was allowed to slip away. The deal never materialized,"" writes Panetta.</p>  <p>President Obama told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" that former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had ""squandered"" the opportunity to be a thriving democracy with a strong military because he ""was much more interested in consolidating his Shia base and very suspicious of the Sunnis and the Kurds"" than creating a united government.</p>  <p>The president said that sending U.S. troops back into Iraq is not the solution.</p>  <p>""We cannot do this for them, because it's not just a military problem It's a political problem,"" he said on Sunday.

Afterwards he's likely to announce new U.S. commitments in combating the virus' spread, the White House said Monday.</p>  <p>Though officials would not specify how the U.S. may increase its response, steps Obama could announce include sending more medical equipment and U.S. doctors and nurses to combat the virus, and ramping up training for local medical teams.</p>  <p>The Defense Department may also be asked to increase its support in handling logistics of the large-scale response already underway, which involves multiple countries and aid groups.</p>  <p>Epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries aren't sending enough resources to the three nations most affected: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p>  <p>The U.S. has committed more than $100 million in the effort to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Obama plans to call on Congress to approve an additional $88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government.</p>  <p>Last week USAID said it would spend $75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment.</p>  <p>But so far the U.S. aid has been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus, which Obama and White House officials are calling a national security problem. Particularly concerning, U.S. officials say, is the potential for instability in the countries where Ebola is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form.</p>  <p>Ebola currently only transmits though contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to human populations worldwide, health experts say.</p>  <p>Speaking Monday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said there was still a ""very low"" likelihood the Ebola virus could mutate in a way that poses a threat to the United States.</p>  <p>""Right now, the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low, but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States,"" Earnest said.</p>  <p>The potential for increased risk to the U.S. homeland has also inspired the more robust response to ISIS terrorists, who Obama announced last week would be the target of an air campaign inside Iraq and Syria.</p>  <p>That mission is run from U.S. Central Command in Tampa, where Obama will receive a briefing on battle plans Wednesday. The White House said the President would also visit servicemen and women during his stop at the facility.</p>  <p>Obama and his aides maintain that ISIS fighters don't currently pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland but warn of the potential for militants with U.S. or Western passports to return home and stage an attack remains a top concern.</p>  <p>Secretary of State John Kerry has been engaging Arab and European nations in building a coalition to fight ISIS, though levels of commitment from foreign partners has remained vague.</p>  <p>""We're pleased with the level of conversations that we're having with these governments and their willingness to contribute in a tangible, important way to this broader effort,"" Earnest said Monday. ""We'll have some announcements to make in terms of what sort of cooperation and involvement and commitment that we have from the international community. And based on the tenor and tone of the kinds of private conversations that are underway right now, we expect those commitments to be substantial.""</p> "

It has increased education for flight crews to teach them what to watch for with people who may be sick. It has worked with hospitals and health care workers to prepare them in case there is a domestic Ebola problem.</p>  <p>Will it be enough?</p>  <p>Ebola is more than a health threat to West Africa; it could become a ""major humanitarian crisis,"" according to United Nations Under-Secretary-General Valerie Amos , if it is not stopped soon enough.</p>  <p>The United Nations said that many millions more will be needed to fight the outbreak. U.N. leaders estimate they need $1 billion to fight the epidemic, with about half needed for the worst-hit country, Liberia.</p>  <p>Political systems and infrastructure are fragile in the countries where the virus is concentrated. Liberia , Sierra Leone and Guinea are still rebuilding their economies after suffering through years of civil wars.</p>  <p>""Now their capacity to deliver the necessities of daily life for their people is on the brink of collapse,"" Amos said. ""The Ebola outbreak poses a serious threat to their post-conflict recovery.""</p>  <p>More people are believed to have died in these countries from secondary diseases like malaria and tuberculosis and from chronic illnesses and pregnancies with complications than from Ebola because the health care systems are so strained.</p>  <p>Heavy rain adds to the risk of waterborne diseases like malaria.</p>  <p>Food security has also become a problem.

Bush or Barack Obama. In place of al Qaeda or ISIS, Jefferson was fighting the Barbary pirates.</p>  <p>In Jefferson's time, European powers conceded to terrorism by paying annual tribute and ransom to groups like the Barbary pirates, according to Robert F. Turner, co-founder of the Center for National Security Law and professor of American Foreign Policy.</p>  <p>Once the American colonies gained independence from Britain, their ships were left without protection from piracy at sea. As American commerce began to increase, the Barbary states targeted American merchant vessels that traveled the seas without a strong naval defense.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Ransom payments</p>  <p></p>  <p>Jefferson believed paying ransom to terrorist organizations was a sign of weakness as a nation.</p>  <p>""Some leaders wanted to pay ransom to get hostages back or pay tribute so they [Barbary pirates] wouldn't take further hostages,"" Turner said. ""Jefferson was a lover of peace, but he was not one to believe that peace would be preserved by weakness. We had to show strength.""</p>  <p>In 1801, pirates across the coast of Tripoli continued to seize American ships and use force to take Americans hostage.</p>  <p>""Jefferson learned of how brutally Western prisoners were being held. They were kept in chains, dungeons, their life span was not long, and a lot of them were dying in prison,"" Turner said.</p>  <p>The pirates of Tripoli declared war on the United States in May 1801, according to a chapter written by Turner and published in The Chicago Journal of International Law. Even before his presidency, Jefferson, as secretary of state, argued that his nation should not offer money to terrorists. It's a principle that persists in America's battle against ISIS.</p>  <p>Today, 62% of Americans oppose paying ransom to ISIS, according to a Reuters-IPSOS poll of 4,685 American adults. The U.S. government paid ransom to free Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from the Taliban, but if those type of negotiations are being held with ISIS, it has not been made public. ISIS seems to be making a statement with its hostages.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Congressional vote</p>  <p></p>  <p>In a recent address to the nation, Obama told the American people that we will ""degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS."" Even though he said he didn't need it, he asked for Congress' vote of approval. In the meantime, Obama ordered military strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</p>  <p>A survey released by CNN indicates ""more than seven in 10 Americans think Obama should ask Congress for the ability to strike ISIS militarily. And eight in 10 Americans support Congress approving military force against ISIS.""</p>  <p>But Congress has left Washington to prepare for midterm elections, so any special authority will come after the fact.</p>  <p>In 1801, Jefferson sent a similar message to the American people. Without congressional approval, Turner said, Jefferson sent a small squadron of ships to the Mediterranean to battle the Barbary pirates.</p>  <p>Jefferson ordered naval leaders to ""protect our commerce and chastise their insolence -- by sinking, burning or destroying their ships and vessels wherever you shall find them,"" according to U.S. naval documents.</p>  <p>The first time Congress was officially notified of Jefferson's plan, which deployed two-thirds of America's naval forces into battle with the enemy, was after the fact, in his first annual message to Congress on December 8, 1801.</p>  <p>""Jefferson's belief was that when war is declared against the United States we don't need Congress' approval to fight back,"" said Turner.</p>  <p>In Jefferson's address to Congress he wrote that, ""Unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go out beyond the line of defense,"" he deployed American naval forces into battle.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Boots on the ground</p>  <p></p>  <p>With such a strong and pressing enemy threatening the United States, Jefferson eventually sent American naval forces into harm's way to fight.</p>  <p>""I'm a believer. I think we ought to be looking for a way to be getting their [ISIS'] attention. It was a widely held opinion to send ships to the Mediterranean, during Jefferson's presidency, because everyone thought, wow, this is outrageous what they're doing to us,"" Turner said.</p>  <p>Today, Obama faces the pressures of not putting American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. While 76% favor American airstrikes against ISIS, 61% of Americans oppose putting U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria, according to a poll released by CNN earlier this month.</p>  <p>The fight against terror is nothing new for the United States. With many similarities dating back to the early 1800s, today Obama has vital decisions to make. Although the President's strategy to defeat ISIS is gradually emerging, America's ability to grow as a nation emanates from the valuable lessons the country learned so early in its existence.</p> "

In October alone Clinton has four trips planned -- to Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas and San Francisco -- where she will combine a paid speech with either a book event or a fundraiser for a Democratic candidate or group.</p>  <p>The strategy is part logistical, part practical for Clinton. But as she considers a presidential run in 2016, it is also calculated. Campaigning for Democrats in 2014 allows her to curry favor with her party ahead of 2016, while selling her book and speaking to paid gigs lets her raise her profile (not that it is needed) and toy with talking points in front of supportive audiences.</p>  <p>Clinton ended her day Thursday in Florida at the sprawling Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables at a fundraiser for Charlie Crist, Florida's Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democratic candidate for governor.</p>  <p>The event was closed to the press, but according to multiple sources in the room, Clinton both touted Crist as the right choice for governor and spoke about bigger picture issues like the a woman's right to choose, growing the middle class and the importance of the space program to Florida.</p>  <p>The audience responded well to Clinton's fundraising calls, according to those in the room, and a Crist campaign spokesman told CNN that the event raised roughly $1 million for the Democrat's effort. The most expensive table at the event cost $50,000.</p>  <p>Clinton also said, according to one source, that she believed in ""redemption and second chances,"" a remark that was seen as an acknowledgment of Crist's past as a Republican who called on Bill Clinton to resign the presidency during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p>  <p>The former Secretary of State started her day , however, at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, a white washed, swanky establishment were the Clinton was paid to appear before 1,200 people at the Commercial Real Estate Women Network Convention.</p>  <p>The event was announced in May, long before her appearance with Crist was announced last month.</p>  <p>Her speech to the women's group focused almost exclusively on attaining an equal playing field for women in business, sports and politics. Clinton called for paid leave, affordable childcare and equal pay for equal work during her speech -- all issues that would likely make up corner stones of a hypothetical presidential run.</p>  <p>""I believe if we don't dare to compete,"" Clinton told the women, ""we will never know what we are capable of doing.""</p>  <p>She later implored the women in the audience to take risks: ""I cannot tell you how important it is for women like us, all of you and me and other like us, to model that risk taking. To get out of our own comfort zones, to be willing to fail. I have done that, too, on a very large stage.""</p>  <p>The crowd was receptive, with one woman holding up a sign from Clinton's failed 2008 presidential campaign.</p>  <p>""You look beautiful,"" one woman screamed at the start of the speech. ""I think it is a grandmother glow,"" a loose and comfortable Clinton retorted.</p>  <p>Shortly after the event, Clinton and her relatively small traveling entourage whisked across town to Book & Books in Coral Gables to sign copies of her memoir ""Hard Choices.""</p>  <p>While Clinton's book events have become more sporadic than they were over the summer, the Miami event was added long after Clinton's attendance at CREW was confirmed.</p>  <p>Over a thousand well-wishers braved the suffocating humidity and soaking rain to shake hands with Clinton and exchange pleasantries.

""Goodness you are well dressed today,"" she joked to a man dressed in a blue stars and stripes sport coat.</p>  <p>As for 2016 -- a question that came up a handful of times -- Clinton dodged and laughed. ""I'm waiting for you to announce, I hope it will be soon,"" said one woman. ""Thank you,"" Clinton responded.</p>  <p>And just like that, after less than 12 hours in Miami, Clinton and her entourage were back to New York.

"34","The great American freakout","CNN.com","2014-10-01 20:07:46","2014-10-05 02:11:44","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/01/politics/great-american-freakout/index.html","Politics"," <p>The Associated Press soon put out a report based on the Iraqi official's comments and the ISIS political/media/security machine shifted into higher gear.</p>  <p>Though federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies quickly cautioned that they could not confirm the Iraqi report, social media exploded with the story. Cable news outlets, including CNN, Fox and MSNBC, led their news hours during the late afternoon with the story. The story was also featured on the evening news broadcasts on NBC and CBS, and a number of news outlets featured it the next morning.</p>  <p>The news organizations stressed that U.S. officials were spreading doubt on the report. Still, often superimposed banners with messages such as ""U.S Blindsided By Iraqi Terror Warning,"" and ""Officials: No Hint of ISIS Plot Against Subways"" left the viewer unsure what to think.</p>  <p>New York officials, prompted by the report, deployed SWAT teams and K-9 units to the city's subway stations, sent uniformed patrol personnel to check on all 450 stations in the subway system, randomly inspected handbags and luggage and kept officers on duty after their shifts ended. By the next day, heavily armed officers were patrolling subway systems in cities across the country.</p>  <p>All because of a report that had been debunked early on.</p>  <p>Welcome to the Great American Freakout: a time and space where the whole country seems to be infused with, and contributing to, an overriding sense of fear of terrorism in general and ISIS in particular. Despite ISIS not having launched any attacks on U.S. soil and repeated assurances from federal officials that they have not detected evidence of any imminent threats, nearly 60% of respondents in a recent CBS/New York Times poll said they felt ISIS was a ""major threat"" to the United States.</p>  <p>Indeed, a CNN poll taken in mid-September indicated that 71% of Americans felt ISIS already had operatives working inside the country.</p>  <p>While there is little question that ISIS could pose a threat to the United States if left unchecked, some security experts said they believe the current hysteria is overblown.</p>  <p>""It's hard to imagine a better indication of the ability of elected officials and TV talking heads to spin the public into a panic, with claims that the nation is honeycombed with sleeper cells, that operatives are streaming across the border into Texas or that the group will soon be spraying Ebola virus on mass transit systems — all on the basis of no corroborated information,"" Daniel Benjamin, a former National Security Council worker who teaches at Dartmouth College, recently told The New York Times.</p>  <p>But the fear is real and it is palpable and its existence says much, not only about the nature of ISIS, but also about the changes in America politics, media and psychology in the last few decades. This is not to say there are no reasons -- real or imagined -- for Americans to be so afraid. In fact there are at least six.</p>  <p>The video: While the ISIS videos did not show the actual slayings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, they did end with the grisly scene of their decapitated heads lying on their bodies. The impact on the viewing American public was chilling, not just for its barbarity, but also its other worldliness.</p>  <p>""The concept of a beheading is so far out of our normal way of thinking,"" said Donna Fiedler, an associate professor of social work at LaSalle University who has study how psychological trauma affects individuals. ""It's not something we regularly think about or even have in our conceptual maps. So this is something completely new and scary.""</p>  <p>It is also intensely personal. Images of most other terror attacks tended not to show individuals who were being killed or about to die. ""I think we shouldn't underestimate the power of the particular; the power of the individual, said Roy Peter Clark, a senior scholar at the Poynter Institute. ""It's like the little girl in the red dress in 'Schindler's List.' There's death all around her. But you can recognize her as an individual. What that inspires is empathy.""</p>  <p>New media/old media: ""ISIS has proved to be very adept, very talented ... in ratcheting up the hysteria, ratcheting up the image of their influence far beyond what their actual military capabilities are,"" former ""CBS News"" anchor Dan Rather said recently on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Indeed, in producing a steady stream of slickly produced videos that can be downloaded onto smartphones and tablets, ISIS has brought its brutality into the palms of our hands, as well as our living rooms. So whenever someone seeks to play down the threat, evidence supporting it is just a click away.</p>  <p>By giving ISIS saturation coverage, old media has played a role in keeping the public on the edge of its seat with regard to ISIS. In many ways ISIS is an irresistible story for television. ISIS is dramatic. It is mysterious. It is potentially dangerous. It has political ramifications. And it has pictures: the life blood of TV. Battlefield pictures, hostage pictures, scary pictures.</p>  <p>""There's something about the structure of television news that makes small threats big,"" said Brian Stelter, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""It's the graphics and the color and the repetition. Probably the repetition more than anything that makes these guys seem like they're 10 feet tall.""</p>  <p>Partisan politics: This week Scott Brown, the Republican candidate for the senate from New Hampshire, unveiled a commercial accusing the Democratic incumbent, Jeanne Shaheen, and President Obama of failing to adequately protect the country against the ISIS threat. ""Radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country,"" Brown intoned on the ad. ""President Obama and Sen. Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat. Not me.""</p>  <p>A Republican operative told CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh that polling and focus group data indicates that, in the wake of ISIS' emergence, national security concerns are gaining in importance, especially among married women with children. Appealing to these swing voters and to the party's conservative base, which according to polls has shown the most concern about ISIS' terror, GOP strategists feel is a key to victory in the midterm elections. As a result, variations of the Brown ad may soon start appearing across the country. Whether they succeed or not, there is no doubt they will amp up the fear quotient.</p>  <p>Related: Politics of fear invade 2014</p>  <p>They're everywhere! They're everywhere! To hear some tell it, ISIS is an enormous army with fifth columns operating in big cities all over the country. It is more than a little disconcerting to hear that the estimates for the number of ISIS fighters have jumped dramatically from about 10,000 to as many as 30,000. But some analysts note that the first projection was a year old, and that the marked increase in fighters may be ephemeral. ""We have seen that when jihadist groups roll over territory they pick up a lot of riff-raff,"" said Daniel Benjamin. ""A lot of young men join up, mainly to get money to feed themselves every day."" So, if ISIS is forced to retreat, many of these new converts may simply melt away.</p>  <p>What is worrying is the number of foreign fighters in the group. The number of foreigners fighting in Syria is estimated to be more than 10,000. That may sound perilous. But the vast majority of them come from places such as Jordan or Tunisia or Saudi Arabia. A few of these, perhaps only a little more than a dozen, are Americans. ""There are only about a dozen Americans fighting for ISIS and two of them are already dead,"" said Peter Bergen, a national security analyst for CNN. ""There is no evidence that any of the Americans fighting in Syria have been involved in plotting attacks here at home. So I think this particular threat of ISIS is wildly overstated.""</p>  <p>Sure, there are thousands of Europeans, many of them hailing from countries like the United Kingdom and France where visas are not required to travel to the United States. But many are already being tracked by their governments, Bergen said. And to carry out an attack, especially a large-scale one, they would have to travel here, acquire weapons, or produce bomb-making material without arousing suspicion.</p>  <p>Perhaps the most dangerous homegrown problem is individuals who are inspired by ISIS to commit murderous acts, such as Alton Nolen, who allegedly beheaded a co-worker in Moore, Oklahoma. But Nolen, who told police he was ""oppressed"" at work, could have found inspiration from any group that has committed violent acts and received widespread news coverage. There may not be anything special about ISIS.</p>  <p>Perhaps, most important, a number of experts said, there is little evidence ISIS is interested in anything but establishing a caliphate in the Middle East. Unlike al Qaeda, attacks on America do not seem to be a priority, at least for now. ""The key thing is that they are in a fundamentally different business,"" said Benjamin. ""They want to take and hold territory.""</p>  <p>Red line fever: Public fear is always heightened when public faith in their leaders to handle pending crises is shaken. Buoyed by his dispatching of Osama bin Laden, public opinion polls gave Obama high -- or at least passably good -- grades for his handling of foreign affairs into the summer of 2013. Then came the issue of Syria's use of chemical weapons. Having drawn what he himself termed a ""red line"" that the Bashar al Assad regime should not cross with regard to using his chemical weapons, Obama seemed to back away from military action when Damascus crossed it. Even though Syria eventually gave up its chemical weapons, Obama came off in the minds of many as feckless and weak. Public faith in his handling of foreign policy was shaken and has yet to recover. In 2012, a Pew Research Center poll found that 38% felt the President was ""not tough enough"" in his foreign policy dealings. After the Syria chemical weapons affair, 51% of the public, according to a Pew poll, felt that way. In the latest CNN/ORC International Poll, 51% of the public said they do not trust Obama as commander in chief of the armed forces.</p>  <p>With so little faith in the ability of their leader to protect them, it is not surprising that the level of fear has risen.</p>  <p>9/11, CYA: When the second jet slammed into a World Trade Center tower on September 11, 2001, the whole way the country looked at its vulnerability to terrorism changed. But, as much as the public mood changed, it is the shift in the psyche of politicians and governmental officials that is perhaps most important. Having missed obvious signals that could have alerted them to the pending attacks and being hauled before the 9/11 Commission to have their mistakes publicly aired, the political mindset is now don't dismiss any threat -- no matter how inconsequential. Rather than calming the public anxiety, politicians may inadvertently stoke it.</p>  <p>""We know how to ratchet up,"" said Juliette Kayyem, a former deputy director of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and now a CNN contributor. ""It's harder to ratchet down.""</p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be any political price to be paid for overplaying a threat and keeping people on edge. But underplaying one and being wrong could mean the end of a politician's career. ""I haven't seen much of a political downside of putting out even a bogus terror threat warning, even if there is only the slightest possibility there is something to it"" said Philip Shenon, author of ""The Commission: An Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation."" ""Nobody's going to hold you to it.""</p> "

Nelson petition, ""for want of a substantial federal question.""</p>  <p>For about four decades that was the final word on the issue, at least legally. Now a generational shift in public acceptance has given same-sex marriage a powerful new voice. Judges around the country -- in state and federal courts -- have spoken with a near unanimity over the past year that millions of gays and lesbians have been denied an equal protection right to tie the knot, or to have their legal unions recognized by their home states.</p>  <p>Opinion: Marriage equality is not like abortion</p>  <p>The public debate is back at the nation's highest court, with the justices being asked to offer a fresh, definitive, and binding ruling. The court next week will return from its summer recess and meet privately to consider appeals originating from same-sex couples in five states: Utah , Oklahoma, Virginia , Wisconsin and Indiana.</p>  <p>If one or more of those petitions are accepted now for review, oral arguments would likely be held early next year, with a monumental opinion expected by late June 2015.</p>  <p>""The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue, under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney. ""It's hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country.""</p>  <p>A patchwork of state laws on the issue</p>  <p>Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Massachusetts became the first to grant the right in 2004.</p>  <p>A Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage would essentially end a patchwork of state laws -- some that allow it, some that do not, and a few that allow protections short of marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships.</p>  <p>The highest court by its nature is a deliberative body, preferring almost by instinct to take things slowly, allowing issues to percolate in the lower courts and in the political discourse.</p>  <p>Did Obama drop Supreme Court hint? White House says no</p>  <p>Not so here. What has been most remarkable about the issue is how rapidly the core constitutional questions have reached the justices, presenting an inevitability among those on both sides of the debate they will get involved.</p>  <p>The court hurried to schedule the appeals from the five states for its closed-door conference, even before all the legal briefs had been filed. That suggests the justices are ready to add the controversies to the docket, and now.</p>  <p>Some conservative activists say this bench should slow down, and ultimately stay out.</p>  <p>""When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides, and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue, it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. ""It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation, instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue.""</p>  <p>Many supporters of ""traditional"" marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward, and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario. But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does and does not do.</p>  <p>A federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory. And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene.</p>  <p>Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted a ""why wait"" attitude may predominate.</p>  <p>""I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,"" she told the Associated Press in July, referring to state bans on interracial marriage, which was not struck down by the high court until 1967. ""If a case is properly before the court, they will take it.""</p>  <p>In their private conference on Monday-- just the nine justices, no one else attends-- the court will discuss among itself whether to grant a ""petition for a writ of certiorari,"" essentially if any of the marriage cases deserve full scrutiny. It takes just four justices to put such petitions on the docket, but five to ultimately prevail on the merits.</p>  <p>""The stakes are incredibly high for Americans and for the legacy of the Roberts court,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. Moderate-conservative ""Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has been a crucial vote on the question gay rights [in the past], is again expected be a crucial vote in this case.""</p>  <p>The high court's big cases this year</p>  <p>More than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in 31 states</p>  <p>State and federal judges in the past year have ruled 39 times in favor of the expanded marriage right, while two have upheld existing laws. All this follows what the Supreme Court in 2013 said peripherally on the issue.</p>  <p>Fifteen months ago, the justices cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after they ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock.</p>  <p>More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 ""Windsor"" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks.</p>  <p>That federal question now morphs into the higher-stakes state jurisdiction, where marriage laws have traditionally been controlled, and where the equal protection issues will ultimately be resolved.</p>  <p>By CNN's count, various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in all 31 states with current bans. A Supreme Court review would put all that litigation on hold.</p>  <p>However, the nine justices have complete discretion to stand on the sidelines for now -- and wait for a majority of these state battles to play out, or for a federal appeals court to uphold a ban.</p>  <p>""In theory, the justices can avoid deciding any question, particularly when there is no real division and there isn't about same-sex marriage -- yet,"" said Goldstein. ""But this is just too important. They can't stay out, it would be ridiculous for the nation's highest court not to decide this issue now.""</p>  <p>Strike down same-sex marriage ban s or allow them to stand</p>  <p>The Supreme Court could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or the justices could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing legislatures, voters, or lower courts to sort it all out, for now.</p>  <p>A CNN/ORC International Poll released more than a year ago found an apparent cultural shift: 53% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007.</p>  <p>Some gay rights activists have expressed concern a national legal strategy aimed at the Supreme Court could prove too risky, and end up slowing momentum toward widespread public acceptance of their relationships. A state-by-state approach pursued by some groups had proven gradually successful, and some supporters of marriage equality fear trying to move too far too fast could create legal setbacks, especially when polls continue to show a sizable number of Americans opposed to the idea.</p>  <p>Marriage equality advocates worry about a broader social backlash on other LGBT issues. But those on all sides of this issue recognize it now sits irretrievably in the hands of the highest court, and that is where the next act of this drama is being played.</p>  <p>Nothing about this political and legal debate in the past decade has been easy, predictive or settled. Like the layered dynamic of marriage itself, putting meaning and force into society's expectations remains an ongoing process, a dialogue that continues to evolve in new ways.</p>  <p>Poll: Confidence in Supreme Court at record low</p>  <p>Differing opinions on the Baker case</p>  <p>A final word about the Baker case, the often forgotten pioneer in the fight for LGBT legal rights. The quarter-century after World War II saw many gay and lesbian Americans slowly acknowledging their identity, and facing discrimination and animus as a result.</p>  <p>The 1969 Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village were a social watershed, with many in the LGBT community citing the riots as helping spark the modern fight for equality.</p>  <p>Activists organized and united -- often uneasily -- forging a strategy to have their voices heard in court. They saw how the Supreme Court in particular was moving toward affirming long-denied rights to those based on skin color and gender.</p>  <p>A year after Stonewall, Richard Baker and James McConnell, students at the University of Minnesota, applied for a marriage license in Minneapolis, but were refused. The state's highest court eventually turned aside their appeal, concluding marriage as between one man and one woman for the purposes of procreation and rearing of children was ""as old as the book of Genesis.""</p>  <p>The subsequent refusal by the nation's highest court to intervene tamped down any further legal or political discussion on the issue for decades. The all-male, all-married bench at the time issued a summary decision without full briefing or oral arguments.</p>  <p>Because of the terseness of that decision, state and federal courts today offer differing opinions on whether Baker is ""irrelevant,"" and has any force today when deciding the constitutional equal protection questions.</p>  <p>Minnesota in August 2013 legalized same-sex marriage, the 13th state to do so.</p> "

"37","Welcome to Obamadale","CNN.com","2014-09-22 15:36:17","2014-10-05 02:11:48","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/22/politics/obamadale-save-democrats/index.html","Politics"," <p>The moniker was bestowed three years ago by a motley crew of Democrats who first met as strangers over martinis at a local restaurant in the early days of President Obama's re-election bid, brought together under the aegis of the ""neighborhood team"" model that defined the campaign's bottom-up volunteer structure.</p>  <p>Led by Kimberley Boggus, a bubbly 33-year-old nursing student, and Sam Reno, a 42-year-old no-nonsense construction crew supervisor, the platoon of volunteers eventually managed to turn out more than 700 Democrats to their local caucus precinct on a chilly January night in 2012 -- and that was for an uncontested race overwhelmingly won by Obama. By November, in another show of force, ""we turned out 87 percent of the Democratic voters in Beaverdale,"" Boggus recalled with evident pride.</p>  <p>After the campaign, Obama's behemoth political organization became Organizing For Action (OFA), but the group has struggled to maintain a coherent identity outside the president's campaigns.</p>  <p>Obamadale, meanwhile, is a small, volunteer-run operation that learned their techniques from Obama campaign officials but has survived and flourished well past the president's re-election fight. Like a political sleeper cell, it is boosting candidates in city council and school board races and playing a key role in this year's closely-watched Iowa Senate race between Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst.</p>  <p>Today, the tightly-knit group of about 20 organizers is one of a handful of Obama-inspired outfits like it across Iowa, an uplifting legacy point for a president who tapped the power of grassroots organizing to win the White House but now struggles with dismal approval ratings and a stalled agenda in Washington. Their talents are already sought out by Democrats thinking about running for president in 2016, and the group is considering whether to throw its weight behind one of them in the Iowa caucuses.</p>  <p>For close watchers of the 2014 midterms , Obamadale is also an emblem of a fearsome and organic Democratic ground game in Iowa that keeps Republican strategists -- who have struggled to keep pace with the Democratic Party's voter turnout machinery -- awake at night.</p>  <p>Related: Hillary Clinton 2016: Fresh start o r deja vu?</p>  <p>Though little-known outside Democratic campaign circles, Obamadale's reputation is so renowned in Iowa that several outside groups working in the state this cycle, including the Ready For Hillary super PAC and environmentalist Tom Steyer's NextGen Climate, have reached out to it for on-the-ground advice. It has also consulted on Democratic races in other parts of the state and worked on issue-based campaigns like a push to get Iowans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.</p>  <p>""Those guys know how to win elections,"" said Brad Anderson, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state and the Iowa state director for Obama's 2012 campaign. ""What's really impressive about Obamadale is they are deeply passionate about the issues and they have been for a long time now, but they understand more than most the strategy of political campaigns, and the importance of phone-calling and door-knocking and election law and person-to-person contact.""</p>  <p>A grassroots political f orce</p>  <p>What's also remarkable about Obamadale is that it thrives independently of the state's Democratic Party infrastructure, even as it consults with the official party on strategy. It is as much a social club as a political operation, deeply embedded in the Beaverdale community and intensely loyal to one another. It IDs voters and secures early voting ballots, but Obamadale members also swap recipes, go to church together, help out when someone is sick and even take road trips together, including a 1,000-mile winter drive from Des Moines to Washington for the president's 2013 inauguration.</p>  <p>""On a campaign you'll be in a phone bank, and it's a big room of people you don't know,"" Boggus said. ""Here, I know the person, I know their story. They are the reason I come back all the time. I miss them if they aren't around in some way. It's 100% because of Obama.""</p>  <p>Beaverdale is a working-class place, mostly white, heavily Catholic and rowed with picket fences and ""Beaverdale Bricks,"" small neo-Tudor homes that have made the community a draw for young families. Though only a short distance from bustling and resurgent downtown Des Moines, Beaverdale feels like its own quaint Midwestern hamlet, where neighbors chat after work in their front yards and gather in family-owned restaurants at night.</p>  <p>The Obamadale members hail from different backgrounds and professions. One is a librarian, one a county health worker, one an office manager. Several are retired.</p>  <p>""What's great about them is they aren't just a bunch of 25-year-olds,"" said Scott Brennan, the Iowa Democratic Party chairman. ""It's an interesting mix of folks that crosses demographic lines and socioeconomic lines. But they are people who are completely committed to the President and committed to Democratic politics.""</p>  <p>With no defined budget, Obamadale members fund their operations out of their own pockets, work out of donated office space at a local law firm and rely on the owner of Tally's, a Beaverdale watering hole that serves a memorable ground-bacon-and-beef burger, to open up the restaurant for Democratic campaign rallies and volunteer meetings.</p>  <p>Door-to-door canvasses are launched off the outdoor deck of Saints Bar and Grill, another Obamadale-friendly establishment in the neighborhood. Events and GOTV pushes are usually coordinated on Obamadale's Facebook group, or by phone or text.</p>  <p>People pitch in when and where they can. ""Some people don't like to call or canvass, but are more than willing to do postcard writing,"" said Tammy Keiter, a program manager at the Polk County Public Health Administration.</p>  <p>John Judge, a mustachioed human resources director who has lived in Beaverdale for 26 years, said that his wife, also a Democrat, ""was reluctant to be a part of it, but she got involved because she liked the people.""</p>  <p>""We have her doing data now,"" he said.</p>  <p>Before a State of the Union watch party in January, amid below-freezing temperatures, Judge helped Reno haul a flat screen television and speakers from his basement across several icy streets into Tally's for the president's speech. It was barely 10 degrees outside, but over 110 people showed up.</p>  <p>""If we don't have at least 100 people in attendance for an event, even at short notice, it's a failure,"" Reno said. ""That's kind of our performance standard.""</p>  <p>Their energy and loyalty to one other is admirable, but Obamadale's most prized asset, for ambitious candidates, is their impressive ability to identify and turn out voters in one of the state's biggest Democratic hubs.</p>  <p>It's why then-congressman Braley wrote a personal letter to Boggus in 2012 thanking her for her work, and why Anderson held a rally inside Tally's on the day he announced his campaign, and why Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is laying groundwork for a presidential campaign, stopped by Saints during a June visit to Iowa to make nice with the Obamadale crew. They gave him a bag of Iowa-shaped chocolates from Beaverdale Confectionary, and Boggus promptly posted a picture of the visit on Facebook.</p>  <p>""Any candidate running in Iowa would benefit from having them in their corner, no doubt,"" Anderson said.</p>  <p>Building on Democratic campaign lists collected over the years, including some of the vaunted Obama campaign voter files obtained during the 2012 race, the Obamadale bunch runs its own data and field programs. Boggus and Reno won't put an exact number on how many voters are in their database from Polk County and other parts of the state, but they say it reaches well into the thousands.</p>  <p>They are quick to attribute their tactical knowledge to the Obama campaign's volunteer training efforts, and the field marshals of the Obama campaign look at them, and similar groups nationwide that adopted the lessons of 2012, like proud parents would.</p>  <p>""We invested in and trained the members of our grassroots movement on real skills,"" said Jeremy Bird, the Obama campaign's national field director and an original architect of their volunteer operations. ""It's no surprise they're now paying it forward and putting everything they learned about building people-focused, data-driven, digitally-savvy campaigns to work to support Democrats up and down the ticket in their home communities.""</p>  <p>But because of Obamadale's local relationships, its work on other races and the mom-and-pop nature of its outfit, the group says its voter intelligence in the Des Moines area is more granular and sophisticated than the larger-scale voter lists of the Obama campaign or the Iowa Democratic Party.</p>  <p>""I definitely think we learned a lot from the (Organizing For America) team model and it influenced our structure, but we went beyond it,"" says Reno.</p>  <p>In addition to phone numbers, emails and voting history, Obamadale organizers know who has soccer practice on what day, who has health issues or who might have a pesky Republican whispering in their neighbor's ear — whatever factor might influence how and when a person might vote.</p>  <p>Friends and work colleagues look to them for political tips as well.</p>  <p>""A woman on my street told me, 'I always wait for whatever sign you put in your front yard because I know who to vote for,'"" Judge said. ""I mean, she is a college-educated, young professional. But most people are not obsessed with this stuff like we are.""</p>  <p>The Obamadale organizers have day jobs, but they sound like David Plouffe or Jim Messina when talking about the efficiencies of their political program.</p>  <p>""When you see these lists that come from the VAN"" — the Democratic Party's voter file software — ""they are not the most accurate,"" Boggus said. ""So we keep our own database of people. They are tiered up. Tier one is our core group of people, about 20 of us. Tier two, they were a little more sporadic with volunteering. Tier three, they will come to events only. Tier four, they don't want to have anything to do with volunteering, but they vote, and we make sure they do early vote.""</p>  <p>Early voting and vote-by-mail, which begins here on Thursday, was decisive in Obama's 8-point victory over Mitt Romney in Iowa in 2012. The campaign tapped their vast field organization to bank tens of thousands of Democratic votes before November, a bonanza that neutralized Republican turnout on Election Day.</p>  <p>Schooled on the same principles, Obamadale is currently making an early vote push in Des Moines aimed at boosting Braley and other Democrats, like 3rd District congressional candidate Staci Appel and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jack Hatch.</p>  <p>""Every good Democrat that we have ID'd for our candidates, we're going to have their vote in the bank,"" Reno said. ""We are only going to be worried about a very small number of our IDs on Election Day. And the people who traditionally have trouble getting to the polls, we are going to get them there.""</p>  <p>Want to be president? Talk to this guy</p>  <p>Hillarydale? And other 2016 c hoices</p>  <p>The next presidential race is on their minds, too.</p>  <p>Over glasses of wine at Tally's last weekend, on the eve of Hillary Clinton's visit to the Harkin Steak Fry, members of Obamadale hashed out their opinions on the likely Democratic field. Clinton, they agreed, was the 2016 frontrunner, though they complained that she was miscast as cold and distant by the media. Clinton was somebody they all said they would consider supporting, but everyone wanted to see a competitive caucus campaign.</p>  <p>""I want to see as many people come through Iowa as possible,"" Boggus said. ""We saw in 2008 that you can be a little-known guy with a funny name and not very much money and do amazing things because you have a ground game.""</p>  <p>They gushed over O'Malley, who visited with the crew this summer. ""I love him,"" said Boggus, who was spotted at the steak fry the next day proudly waving a ""Ready for Warren"" placard in support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive darling from Massachusetts.</p>  <p>""If Elizabeth Warren and Hillary were sitting at different tables at a place like this, most people would go over and talk to Warren,"" said Ben Guise, a retired state employee.</p>  <p>Reno would not rule out supporting one of the presidential candidates, though he said the decision ""would have to respect everybody's ownership of the group."" He said candidates would have to prove their grassroots credentials by stepping out of their comfort zones and listening to voters up close. Stopping by an Obamadale-run event or two wouldn't hurt their cause, he said.</p>  <p>""Honestly, we are doing this for free,"" Reno said. ""And so would have to decide who is worthy of our effort before we get behind them. We are all volunteers. Candidates need to justify the effort we give them, which includes being accessible and respecting how grassroots groups like ours can add some sanity to electoral process, by helping neighbors talk to neighbors in even-minded tones about the issues.""</p>  <p>As for the name, it seems like Obamadale is here to stay. Braleydale and Hillarydale, they said, don't roll off the tongue as easily.</p>  <p>""We are deeply loyal to the President,"" Reno said.</p> "
"38","Why does GOP fight early voting?","CNN.com","2014-10-02 15:05:04","2014-10-05 02:11:50","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/01/opinion/brazile-early-voting-rights-ohio/index.html","Politics"," <p>These two reasons are why I'm outraged by what's going on in Ohio.</p>  <p>This week, the Supreme Court, on the eve of early voting, ruled that efforts by Ohio Republicans to restrict early voting days were acceptable . This gets rid of what's called the Golden Week in Ohio -- the period when voters can register and cast their ballot at the same time.</p>  <p>It ended convenient voting hours, when Ohioans could vote after a long day at work -- as late as 9 p.m. It also ended voting on one of the two Sundays before Election Day when many folks head to their polling place after church. These have been hallmarks of the Ohio voting system, but the Supreme Court and Republicans have yet again changed the rules in the middle of the game -- all to create barriers between people and the ballot box.</p>  <p>And unfortunately it's not just Ohio where Republicans have doggedly tried to restrict or cut early voting days or hours. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP have reduced and limited the early voting period , including weekend voting. In North Carolina , the Republican governor and legislature took away a week of early voting. And in Georgia, a GOP legislator lamented a county's move to expand early voting , saying he would ""prefer more educated voters"" over black early voters.</p>  <p>Think this doesn't have any real impact? Think again. In 2012, a third of voters cast a ballot before Election Day , in person or by mail -- more than double the rate during the 2000 election. All told, more than 18 million voters cast an early in-person ballot when President Obama was re-elected.</p>  <p>Voting shouldn't be a challenge. It should be as easy and accessible as possible. We shouldn't require forms of ID that folks don't have, we shouldn't restrict days or hours that allow working people a chance to both do their job and exercise their democratic right, and we damn well shouldn't be throwing up new obstacles midstream.</p>  <p>When obstacles are thrown up, we should have protections for voters. That's why I was so frustrated when the Supreme Court last summer gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder.</p>  <p>The Supreme Court ruled that there's no need for national oversight when localities and states with a history of racially discriminatory voting laws make voting rule changes. I'm not alone with my frustration. A recent poll from Lake Research and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that nationally, 69% of the American public favors restoring the VRA, with only 10% opposing.</p>  <p>Voters of both parties, all races, and every region across the country favor a congressional proposal to restore the Voting Rights Act. I'm hopeful that Republicans and Democrats will, in the lame duck session after the 2014 elections or in the beginning of the next session of Congress, hammer out legislation that restores oversight and protects voters.</p>  <p>As Democrats, we believe in giving every eligible citizen the opportunity to vote -- whether it's early because they can't take off work on Election Day or absentee because they might have plans to be out of town. And we believe this for two reasons. First, when more people vote, Democrats win. That's because more Americans agree with us on the big issues and the big questions -- like who's got my back? But second, it's because our democracy is better when more people have skin in the game. Our democracy relies on participation and we've never done better by excluding folks.</p>  <p>If there's one thing we can count on, it's that the GOP is going to continue to come up with last minute schemes to make it more complicated, more confusing, or just plain more difficult for honest, hardworking citizens to vote on Election Day or before. It's up to us to stop them.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine .</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

While they will be able to critique him and highlight how they would try do better, they will also face great pressure to outline their own visions for their future.</p>  <p>The task won't be easy, since the Democratic Party is not all on the same page. While philosophical fractures within the GOP are well-known -- among neo-isolationists like Sen. Rand Paul and hawkish conservatives like Sen. John McCain -- there are also deep divisions and tensions within the Democratic Party that candidates will have to sort out.</p>  <p>A number of foreign-policy agendas have taken shape among the Democrats, and all are likely to be part of the debate in the primary season.</p>  <p>There are the liberal internationalists, arguably the most dominant voice among Democrats. They include the President, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who believe that the United States must remain active overseas to maintain global order and protect American interests.</p>  <p>Liberal internationalists believe that it is essential to work through international institutions like NATO or the United Nations rather than to go it alone. They accept the need for military force, but also insist on the use of diplomacy and economic sanctions. Another pillar of liberal internationalism is that public sacrifice is needed when the nation goes to war, through higher taxes, volunteerism or, in earlier times, a draft.</p>  <p>There is also a strong anti-war faction that has been a central part of Democratic politics since the 1960s. For these Democrats, who are based primarily in the grass roots rather than among Washington elites, military force should be used only under the most extreme circumstances. They tend to distrust what elected and military officials say when justifying the use of force, always remembering the lies of Vietnam.</p>  <p>This world view posits that military force is very often a poor method for handling international problems and creates more problems than it is worth. This view rarely finds mainstream candidates, since these arguments play into conservative claims that Democrats are weak on defense. But occasionally their voice is heard.</p>  <p>In 2004, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont made this argument about Iraq. Today, some wonder whether possible candidates like Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts might position themselves that way.</p>  <p>Finally, there are the liberal hawks. This faction has been much less vocal since the negative fallout from President Bush's war in Iraq but still lurks in the party. Liberal hawks are more open than their colleagues to the use of military force, even unilaterally, and less concerned about national sacrifice.</p>  <p>The tradition was made famous by Washington Sen. Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, who in the 1970s was among the most prominent ""neo-conservatives."" Today some observers see Democrats who could succeed Jackson like New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez. ""So my friends on the left need to understand,"" he said, ""that it is the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.""</p>  <p>With the chaos overseas growing in cases such as Russian aggression and the rise of a so-called Islamic state, they could become more of a force once again in the campaign.</p>  <p>Candidates won't have to choose one side or another, since most politicians don't fit neatly into one category. But they will need to navigate carefully as they craft their message and figure out ways to develop a platform that can bring together as much of the party as possible.</p>  <p>Some possible candidates, such as Hillary Clinton and former Virginia Sen. James Webb, have an eclectic record that could enable them to appeal to multiple constituencies. The best candidates will be the one who can offer a coherent and powerful vision of what the United States and the world should be as we enter into this period.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine .</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

Barack Obama have in President Barack Obama. Earlier this year, one in four Democrats and two in three Independents said this administration has let them down, according to a CBS News/New York Times Poll .</p>  <p>It seems once the euphoria of 2008 wore off, voters were shocked to learn the country's first black president wasn't as radical as his election. He's shown himself to be idealistic but methodical. A compassionate figure with a thing for drones and kill lists.</p>  <p>These days, he is thinking legacy. But what will history say about the man who was voted into office with a mandate to end the war in Iraq and now will likely leave that office with a new war in Iraq trailing behind?</p>  <p>As the bombing in Syria by the United States, and to a lesser extent, a cadre of allies, was getting under way, Obama delivered a thoughtful address to the United Nations on Wednesday.</p>  <p>He called out Arab nations that ""accumulate wealth through the global economy, and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down."" He dared to challenge Muslims to reject those who rally around a bastardized version of the Islamic faith and then use that doctrine to justify chaos. He spoke of a crossroad between ""war and peace,"" ""disorder and integration,"" ""fear and hope.""</p>  <p>Remember that word? Hope.</p>  <p>It was the word Obama used to ignite the movement that would lift him from his position as a little-known junior senator from Illinois into the White House and onto the world stage. He promised to change the way things had always been. Now Moore and others are disappointed because they believed him.</p>  <p>After winning the Iowa Democratic caucus in January 2008, Obama told the rabid crowd that the country was choosing unity over division and that ""this was the place, this was the moment where America remembered what it means to hope.""</p>  <p>Six years later, a Gallup poll found fewer Iowans approve of the job Obama's doing than the national average -- 38% to 43%. What will history say about the man who encouraged immigrants to dream big and then left them hanging for the sake of the midterm election? Who has overseen 54 consecutive weeks of private-sector job growth, the longest stretch in history. Who pledged to close Guantanamo Bay. Who OK'd the mission that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden. Who promised to be transparent.</p>  <p>In 2007, Oprah Winfrey gave a speech in support of Obama. She said, ""We need a new way of doing business in Washington, D.C. and in the world. ... I'm tired of politics as usual."" And yet here we are.</p>  <p>George W. Bush left Afghanistan and Iraq for Obama to sort through, and now it is likely Obama will leave behind Iraq and Syria for his successor.</p>  <p>Opinion: America's wartime president</p>  <p>At the U.N., Obama explained in detail why it was important to defeat ISIS. Instead of a soaring delivery, he spoke plainly about the choices that lie in front of us all, intelligently shifting the point of emphasis from destroying terrorist groups to derailing their instruments of recruitment, funding, and their very philosophy. ""No God condones this terror,"" he said.</p>  <p>""There can be no reasoning -- no negotiation -- with this brand of evil,"" he said. ""The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.""</p>  <p>And then he reiterated that he is prepared to lead in this force for the remainder of his presidency.</p>  <p>It was the kind of rhetoric we were accustomed to hearing from his 2008 opponent, Sen. John McCain, who has yet to see a war he didn't want us to be a part of. It was the kind of rhetoric his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, said would make him the better leader.</p>  <p>It was the kind of rhetoric that has become as much a part of Obama's complicated legacy as the Affordable Care Act, the rise in LGBT rights and the slow, but real, economic recovery.</p>  <p>Syria now becomes the seventh predominantly Muslim country in which he has authorized military strikes. Perhaps his earlier persona contributed to his resistance to do so sooner, despite the advice of his inner circle. When one takes power under the guise of a peaceful change agent, one should pause before ordering airstrikes, if for no other reason than not wanting to contribute to the Earth's carnage.</p>  <p>But for the next two years, he is committed to doing just that. He doesn't have much of a choice, really. Terrorists are reportedly developing articles of clothing that explode. I shudder to think what will be in store for airline passengers dealing with TSA screenings if such a thing comes to pass.</p>  <p>How will history remember Obama? What will his legacy be? It appears a lot of that will depend on how many people the U.S. kills before he leaves office.</p>  <p>That's not why many of us voted for him, but I guess the rest of the world didn't get the memo. We voted not to bomb people. To end the wars. To stop spying.</p>  <p>I wonder if he's as disappointed in the way things have turned out as the rest of us.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

His administration's handling of the immigration crisis on the southern border has amplified the small chorus.</p>  <p>However, such a step is considered far-fetched, especially after House Speaker John Boehner expressed disagreement with the premise in this case.</p>  <p>Obama has clashed repeatedly and sharply with Republicans during his presidency.</p>  <p>Cheney, however, did offer limited support for House Republican efforts to sue Obama over their claims he has abused his authority on a number of occasions by unlawfully going around Congress to carry out policy.</p>  <p>They're focusing their unusual legal action on a piece of Obamacare, a major political flashpoint between the GOP and the President and his supporters.</p>  <p>""I'm glad to see the House Republicans are challenging him at least legally at this point.

After a pause, he elaborated. ""That's basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.""</p>  <p>Rand Paul: 'I am not opposed to birth control'</p>  <p>Next question.</p>  <p>The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus -- a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda. And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him: burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesn't stray so far from the Republican line that he won't be able to win the party's presidential nomination.</p>  <p>Another student here pressed him on ""the drug war,"" asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He said he wasn't supportive of drug use, explaining that pot ""is not that great,"" but said drug laws should be left up to states. Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana, he said, and we should be watching carefully.</p>  <p>Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit.</p>  <p>His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal.</p>  <p>""Rand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places,"" the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March.</p>  <p>Paul, reared in libertarian politics, found support there because he railed against the National Security Administration's invasive surveillance operations, calling them an absurd violation of privacy. It's his go-to topic when he talks to young people.</p>  <p>Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones.</p>  <p>Soon after, he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee. Paul and his wife, Kelley, danced and sang along to Chumbawamba, the 90s-era pop band with an anarchist streak.</p>  <p>We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of ""Hambycast.""</p>  <p>After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people — as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party.</p>  <p>On the topic of drugs, I picked up where the student left off, wondering if Paul, as president, would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin. He hedged.</p>  <p>""My position has not been for legalization, my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this, and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance,"" he said.</p>  <p>Then I asked about same-sex marriage, something Paul did not touch on in his remarks. Almost 80% of people under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. It's hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with America's youth. And it's not just teenaged and 20-somethings: A clear majority of Americans, 55%, support same-sex marriage.</p>  <p>Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws.</p>  <p>""I don't want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage,"" he told me. ""Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. It is a local issue and always has been.""</p>  <p>But can Republicans win a national election if they aren't in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter? He took a soft tone.</p>  <p>""Society's changing,"" he said. ""I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they're like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it's been rethought. The President's rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.""</p>  <p>It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage.</p>  <p>""The bottom line is, I'm old fashioned, I'm a traditionalist,"" he said. ""I believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don't really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue.""</p>  <p>""You could rethink it at some point, too?"" I asked him.</p>  <p>He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn't a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul's complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.</p> "

But he came out of retirement six years ago and rode a GOP wave back into office. If voters return him to office this fall, the 67-year-old will have served over 20 years as governor, making him the longest-serving executive in American history.</p>  <p>One reason for Branstad's winning streak is that he's much more of a hardball politician than his aw-shucks Midwestern demeanor suggests. Earlier this year, Branstad, the definition of an establishment Republican, successfully deployed his political machine in an effort to reclaim the Iowa GOP from the clutches of tea party leadership.</p>  <p>So far this year, in his race against Democrat Jack Hatch, he's been able to weather administration scandals and accusations of corruption. One Democrat told me that for Iowa voters, Branstad is ""like an old sweater"" — just the comfortable choice.</p>  <p>Obamadale: The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats?</p>  <p>Branstad was talking about his whiskers while giving me a private tour of the picturesque Iowa state capital for the latest episode of ""Hambycast,"" showing off the knick-knacks and ceremonial gifts that decorate his hideaway office, normally off-limits to reporters.</p>  <p>He pointed proudly to his hunting trophies, a photo with Pope John Paul II, and an Iowa Hawkeyes football jersey with ""BRANSTAD"" emblazoned on the back. Upstairs in the state capitol, we examined baseballs signed by players who had jogged the bases at Field of Dreams in Dyersville. Then we were guided up to the very top of the gilded state capitol for a stunning autumn view of downtown Des Moines.</p>  <p>As the talk turned to 2016 and the looming parade of Republican presidential contenders set to march through Iowa, Branstad brushed off criticism that the caucuses favor uncompromising social conservatives over more moderate Republicans.</p>  <p>Hambycast: Hillary Clinton's madcap media mob</p>  <p>He has a point. Mitt Romney, not exactly a favorite son of the Christian right, almost won the caucuses. There's a sizable pool of mainstream Republicans here waiting to be courted, and in a crowded presidential field, a candidate can win the state with a plurality — and without unified support from social conservatives.</p>  <p>""You need to come here early and often,"" Branstad said, invoking the example of Rick Santorum, who came out of nowhere to win Iowa after campaigning in the state's 99 counties (and, it should be noted, after wearing his conservative Catholic faith on his sleeve).</p>  <p>Branstad would not say if he would endorse a candidate but said he's favorable to Republican governors — no surprise there — a comment that should warm the hearts of Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Mike Pence.</p>  <p>Jeb Bush heading to 2016 primary state</p>  <p>As for the (in)famous Ames Straw Poll, that media-saturated, oft-criticized and nonbinding summertime test of candidate support, Branstad backed away from previous suggestions that the fundraiser should be scrapped.</p>  <p>I asked him if the GOP-run Straw Poll will actually happen next summer in the run-up to the caucuses. Branstad said maybe, but floated another option.</p>  <p>""It's going to depend on the candidates and who is willing to participate,"" he said. ""I think having a series of fundraisers regionally around the state would be a good alternative.""</p> "
"44","Hillary Clinton's madcap media mob","CNN.com","2014-09-23 15:12:16","2014-10-05 02:12:12","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/politics/hambycast-iowa-hillary-clinton/index.html","Politics"," <p>She's done a national book tour and the paid lecture circuit, but Clinton got an up-close look at today's frenzied political news environment last weekend when she visited Iowa for the first time in seven years, a spectacle primed for an avalanche of media coverage given her expected campaign and her tortured history with the Hawkeye State.</p>  <p>I joined more than 200 other reporters who swarmed the scene and tweeted away, even though most Americans on social media that day probably cared more about Robert Griffin's ankle.</p>  <p>The press scrum that assembled to witness noncandidates Hillary and Bill Clinton flip Hy-Vee steaks with Sen. Tom Harkin -- behind a barricade, of course -- was as large, if not larger, than the media hordes that covered her at the height of her 2008 campaign.</p>  <p>One reporter got whacked in the head with the butt of a big television camera. Another photographer dramatically toppled off his ladder while straining to get a shot. It was a little absurd. When the Clintons approached the media zoo for question time, Bill Clinton leaned in and relished the scene. Hillary kept her distance.</p>  <p>Political Twitter, though, wasn't just a stream of gauzy Instagram-filtered pics of the Clintons: It was also rife with media criticism, some fair and some not, from politicos and press critics who pointed to the event as another example of lazy ""pack journalism"" with little journalistic upside.</p>  <p>The sniping had some credibility. What was the competitive advantage of being there, just one more reporter among the herd, all of us racing around to get the same quotes and the same pictures?</p>  <p>This was especially true for the many journalists in attendance who rarely travel outside of Washington or New York to cover politics but decided to open up their travel budget for this one trip.</p>  <p>Couldn't their time have been better spent reporting on an undercovered Senate or governor's race in some other part of the country, far away from the rest of the media scrum? Of course, the academics would say. But the incentive structure of today's click-driven news economy begs to differ. Hillary gets eyeballs. Arkansas' Tom Cotton does not. This is the world we live in.</p>  <p>As much as I believe in straying far, far away from the rest of the media pack -- this was a lynchpin argument in "" Did Twitter Kill The Boys on the Bus? ,"" the Harvard Kennedy School study I wrote last year about the hyperactive political news media -- I did find value in covering the Steak Fry.</p>  <p>For one, I lived Clinton's 2008 campaign up close as an embedded producer for CNN, living on her campaign plane for six months and ingesting every single stump speech, gaffe and gross turkey sandwich in front of me. It was useful for me to see whether her political skills and her willingness to play the Iowa game had shifted since she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama.</p>  <p>The whole thing was broadcast on CNN and C-SPAN, which is fine and good, but television cameras don't pick up the small things reporters can sniff on the ground: The receptiveness of the crowd, the impressive organizational prowess of the once-meager Ready for Hillary super PAC, the absurdity of the staged photo-ops and press scrums, and the rope-line body language of Clinton herself, which was noticeably more cautious than her husband Bill (some things never change).</p>  <p>Those are the kind of atmospherics I chose to focus on when crafting my report from the scene as well as this week's episode of Hambycast.</p>  <p>And of course, there's the reporting that went on nowhere near the Steak Fry, those meetings with Democrat and Republican sources in and around Des Moines. Was all that worth the plane ticket to DSM? Definitely. Will I go somewhere where other reporters aren't for my next trip? You bet.</p>  <p>Watching the Iowa theatrics from afar, the journalist Dave Weigel wrote that Hillary's protocandidacy is a ""problem for the media, which simultaneously is ready right now to cover her like a nominee -- 200 reporters! -- and yet so palpably bored with how she talks, and runs.""</p>  <p>But the ever-growing press corps, weaponized by Twitter , will also be a problem for Clinton and her team, who must find ways of engaging with a massive entourage of reporters that is constantly on the hunt for ""news"" -- i.e., anything off-message or click-worthy -- while also trying to drive the conversation on their own terms.</p>  <p>The hyperguarded Mitt Romney encountered this same dilemma during his ill-fated 2012 presidential bid.</p>  <p>Watch more Hambycasts</p>  <p>When he avoided the press, he got punished by a cranky and access-starved press corps. When he held a rare press conference to push a policy idea, his comments were drowned out by a cacophony of horse-race questions or some Twitter-driven ""controversy"" unfolding hundreds of miles away.</p>  <p>So he chose to get his message out on his own terms, through paid media or friendly Fox News interviews, without the filter of the ""traditional"" press, whatever that means. In the end, it wasn't enough.</p>  <p>That political reporters are motivated by conflict, personality and the ups-and-downs of a campaign is nothing new , and it's unlikely to change despite carping from media critics.</p>  <p>What has changed is the atomized and hyperactive social news environment we all live in now, and it's changed dramatically since Clinton last announced a presidential bid in 2007, before the iPhone existed and well before Twitter took hold among the political class.</p>  <p>If she runs again, there will be reporters covering her campaign who were barely in diapers when Bill Clinton was elected President, who came of age in an era of Internet journalism that prizes exclusives and micronews, who have very different incentives than the television and newspaper reporters that the Clintons dealt with during his presidency or her last campaign. They hold the Clintons in high-regard, but not nearly as high as the regard the Clintons have for themselves.</p>  <p>Hillary got a taste of this during her book tour -- her de-facto re-entry into political life -- when various comments that had even a whiff of controversy or gaffe-status rocketed across the Internet at warp speed, with an assist from Republican opposition researchers.</p>  <p>Life as a candidate, of course, is something much different. Clinton knows this. But her Iowa pop-in was her first glimpse of the thorny new reality that awaits.</p> "

But two weeks later, the tea party lost out on a golden opportunity to oust a sitting GOP lawmaker when Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi edged out state Sen. Chris McDaniel in a primary runoff.</p>  <p>McDaniel, who enjoyed strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups, narrowly edged out Cochran in the June 3 primary, but with neither man cracking 50% (there was a third Republican candidate on the ballot who grabbed 1.5% of the vote), the contest moved to last week's runoff, which Cochran won by fewer than 7,000 votes.</p>  <p>Would Cochran's strategy work elsewhere?</p>  <p>The senator's victory was aided by votes from African-American Democrats, who were courted during the runoff campaign by pro-Cochran forces. But McDaniel alleges his team has found voting irregularities and is not conceding.</p>  <p>""Interpreting the Cochran win as some kind of 'Empire Strikes Back' moment is an overreach,"" Republican communications strategist Keith Appell told CNN.</p>  <p>""Republican leaders and their establishment backers dodged a bullet in Mississippi, but there is still a deep and active discontent among the grass roots, and it will only continue to manifest until the leadership reconnects with its base. Anyone who seriously thinks otherwise is delusional,"" said Appell, a senior vice president at CRC Public Relations, a Washington public relations firm that has had many conservative clients.</p>  <p>Some victories but a lot of defeats</p>  <p>Anti-establishment forces have scored some victories this season. They knocked off another GOP incumbent, 91-year-old Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas , who lost his congressional primary runoff last month to a tea party-backed candidate.</p>  <p>And in May, tea party-backed Ben Sasse came out on top in Nebraska's GOP Senate primary. The same night conservative Alex Mooney, who was supported by anti-establishment groups, won the GOP contest in West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District. But those were the major highlights for the tea party in a year when mainstream Republicans have enjoyed most of the victories.</p>  <p>Primary challenges from the right shook up the Republican Party in the last two election cycles. But they have also hurt the party's chances of winning back control of the Senate from Democrats, effectively costing the GOP five potentially winnable elections since 2010.</p>  <p>So what's happening this cycle?</p>  <p>""Establishment Republicans and incumbents have learned to run against tea party-backed candidates,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper.</p>  <p>And outside help is making a difference.</p>  <p>""I think the Republican establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles. There is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""I think in the past it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups,""</p>  <p>Inside Politics: The Chamber of Commerce's next target</p>  <p>The battles ahead</p>  <p>Anti-establishment forces still have an outside chance to score an upset in Tennessee and Kansas in early August.</p>  <p>""For those folks who are looking to knock off a Republican senator in a primary this cycle, the opportunities are down to Tennessee and Kansas,"" Gonzales said. ""There is still some time for those races to develop, but they will both take work to get the challenger campaigns to the same level as Chris McDaniel in Mississippi.""</p>  <p>Two-term Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is an inviting target. He's known as a lawmaker willing to work with Democrats to broker bipartisan deals. He's facing off against a bunch of primary challengers. The one with the best shot of toppling Alexander appears to be state lawmaker Joe Carr.</p>  <p>""Make no mistake about it -- the fight that Chris McDaniel started in Mississippi will continue here in Tennessee,"" Carr said after the Mississippi runoff.</p>  <p>But unlike McDaniel, polls indicate Carr's the distinct underdog to Alexander.</p>  <p>In Kansas, Sen. Pat Roberts is seeking a fourth term in office. Milton Wolf -- a second cousin (once removed) of President Barack Obama -- touts himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the GOP establishment.</p>  <p>Wolf's campaign has tried to portray Roberts as more about Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent out a room to him. Roberts owns a rental property in his hometown of Dodge City and a home in the Washington suburbs, where he spends much of his time.</p>  <p>But Wolf, a radiologist, came under attack over old Facebook postings in which he exposed private patient X-rays and other personal information -- poking fun at the dead or wounded. Wolf was forced to admit he made ""insensitive"" comments .</p>  <p>Like Carr, polls indicate Wolf trails far behind Roberts.</p>  <p>But Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, a national tea party group that backs Wolf, told CNN that the challenger is ""able to bring a lot of excitement and enthusiasm among the grass roots. And that's the problem Roberts has. He lives in Washington. He's pretty much out of touch with the people of Kansas. So I think that that frustration with Washington has manifested itself in growing support for Milton Wolf.""</p>  <p>Winning by losing?</p>  <p>The next high-profile primary is Georgia's GOP Senate runoff on July 22, but the tea party doesn't appear to be much of a factor there. Businessman David Perdue and Rep. Jack Kingston advanced to a runoff, but the three more conservative candidates didn't.</p>  <p>But regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, tea party leaders said they've changed the conversation in Washington.</p>  <p>""The tea party is winning by losing in the sense that you don't see any Republicans saying, 'Let's pass immigration reform that gives a path to citizenship. Let's make it easier for the President to raise the debt ceiling.' Almost all Republicans have shifted right,"" said John King, CNN's chief national correspondent.</p>  <p>Another strategist said this year's contests aren't the final chapter in the struggle between the grass roots and the establishment.</p>  <p>""The party remains deeply divided, and both sides have the resources and commitment needed to take the fight into 2015 and 2016,"" wrote Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""The war is likely to get messier and the division more consequential before the two sides look for ways to bridge their differences. That should please Democrats.""</p>  <p>What does that mean for November?</p>  <p>The candidates who emerge from this year's primaries could have an immediate impact come November.</p>  <p>Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party). But in the midterm elections, the party is defending 21 of the 36 seats up for grabs, with half of those Democratic-held seats in red or purple states. In the House, the Democrats need to pick up a challenging 17 Republican-held seats to win back the majority from the GOP.</p>  <p>""We learned that Republicans across the board have picked highly electable candidates and have improved their chances of taking over the Senate,"" said Bonjean, the GOP consultant.</p>  <p>But Democrats disagree, and say that even though mainstream Republicans are winning in the primaries, those candidates are moving further to the right to secure victories, which will likely hurt them when they face a more moderate general election electorate in November.</p> "
"46","Why is this GOP governor talking health care with Obama?","CNN.com","2014-10-03 21:25:48","2014-10-05 02:12:20","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/politics/pence-obama-health-care/index.html","Politics"," <p>The catch: Pence wants to do it with a conservative twist.</p>  <p>At least, that's how he's selling his proposal. And his political future could hinge on whether the first-term Republican can convince conservatives that he's not just rebranding Obamacare.</p>  <p>Pence has spent much of his first two years in office trying to strike a bargain on one of the health care law's core components. Indiana will expand Medicaid coverage, Pence says, but only if it's allowed to do it through a tweaked version called the ""Healthy Indiana Plan,"" which also requires users to make small payments into health savings accounts.</p>  <p>He spent five minutes chatting with Obama at the Evansville airport, lobbying to have the Health and Human Services Department green-light Indiana's request, before the president visited a factory in Princeton, Indiana.</p>  <p>""The president and I talked through a number of substantive issues that have arisen in our discussions over the Healthy Indiana Plan,"" Pence said afterward, ""and I appreciated the opportunity to call the matter to his personal attention.""</p>  <p>He said he also spoke last night with top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, and will meet Monday with HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.</p>  <p>Pence's focus on a health care expansion is at the center of his effort to evolve from a firebrand conservative congressman to an executive with a record of accomplishment ahead of a White House run that many Republicans close to him see as a question of when -- not if.</p>  <p>As he flirts with a 2016 bid, Pence could be the best test of whether a conservative can run nationally after expanding a government-sponsored health system. Mitt Romney faced hurdles with conservatives during his 2012 presidential bid, in part because of the health care system he put in place when he was the governor of Massachusetts.</p>  <p>Other governors who could seek the 2016 GOP nomination -- including New Jersey's Chris Christie and Ohio's John Kasich -- have accepted Obamacare's extension of Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of their state's residents.</p>  <p>But Pence has taken an important extra step. He's arguing that Indiana's proposal is the solution to Medicaid's woes. He called Indiana's plan ""a better and more effective alternative"" to traditional Medicaid in a letter to Obama on Thursday.</p>  <p>The Healthy Indiana Plan's key departure from traditional Medicaid is that users are required to contribute small amounts of their own money to personal health savings accounts. The program was developed under former Gov. Mitch Daniels and initially served about 40,000 adults under a Medicaid waiver that HHS granted before Obamacare's existence. After Pence was elected in 2012, he said a slightly updated version called the ""Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0"" is the only vehicle he'd consider for expanding coverage.</p>  <p>""Since its inception, the Healthy Indiana Plan has empowered its members to take greater personal ownership over their health care decisions and become more cost-conscious consumers of health care services,"" Pence wrote to Obama on Thursday.</p>  <p>But some conservatives say Indiana's changes to Medicaid are just ""window dressing.""</p>  <p>""It seems like he's just sort of taken the moniker of health savings accounts and applied it to this brand new entitlement in hoping that this window dressing will make it conservative,"" said Jonathan Ingram, the research director for the Foundation for Government Accountability, which has set up a website -- StopPence.com -- blasting Pence's handling of the issue.</p>  <p>Even Pence's usually-reliable allies have been critical. Chase Downham, Americans for Prosperity's Indiana state director, called it a ""troubling deviation from the solid, free-market approach Gov.

While it's unlikely Romney will run, he's leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign. Meanwhile, of course, everyone is watching Clinton for signs that she might join the race -- and she's doing little to discourage the attention.</p>  <p>The 2016 contest is far from a lock. But if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president, would there be any surprises?</p>  <p>Luckily, with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view, we have an idea of what a Romney-Clinton match up might look like. Here are some areas that would be interesting to watch:</p>  <p>Russia</p>  <p>Critics have faulted Clinton for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia. As secretary, Clinton famously offered her Russian counterpart a ""reset"" button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more.</p>  <p>But President Putin's incursion into Ukraine and his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country's bloody civil war, both of which occurred after Clinton stepped down, have chilled the relationship Clinton hoped would thaw.</p>  <p>Enter Romney, who was mocked after calling Russia the United States' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during an interview with CNN in 2012. At the time, Clinton called his remarks ""dated.""</p>  <p>Romney struck back in an interview with Fox this summer, calling Clinton's reset button ""one of the most embarrassing incidents in American foreign policy.""</p>  <p>Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton's 2008 effort, underlined the former secretary of state's real world foreign policy experience.</p>  <p>""As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a foreign policy record,"" Sefl said. ""I'm not entirely sure what Mitt Romney has besides campaign positions.""</p>  <p>What about gaffes?</p>  <p>Romney famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that Democrats used to paint him as out-of-touch.</p>  <p>From the ""couple of Cadillacs"" he said his wife owned, to the 47 percent of Americans he said were dependent on government, to his offhand remark that ""I like being able to fire people"" who provide bad service, Romney handed opponents an opening.</p>  <p>But while promoting her book ""Hard Choices"" this summer, Clinton made some missteps of her own. The former first lady said she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001. Earlier this year, she told an audience in New Orleans that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of Secret Service concerns.</p>  <p>Were Romney to run again, Clinton's stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns.</p>  <p>A former Romney aide suggested Romney's more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump.</p>  <p>""She's rusty,"" former Romney 2012 spokesman Ryan Williams said of Clinton. ""Gov. Romney has been through two campaigns at this point. He's been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates. She certainly would have a steeper learning curve.""</p>  <p>Clinton has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups. But she hasn't crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like Romney.</p>  <p>That potential advantage could extend to presidential debates. Romney shot up in the polls after surprising President Obama in their first one-on-one debate in October 2012. Clinton hasn't gone through that grueling experience since 2008.</p>  <p>But CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said Romney would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he doesn't understand them.</p>  <p>""It was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant. I still think that's there,"" Brownstein said. ""I don't think Romney gets away from that no matter who he's running against.""</p>  <p>Women</p>  <p>In 2008, Clinton's presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" She continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the State Department and through her family's philanthropic arm, the Clinton Foundation.</p>  <p>Romney struggled with women voters in 2012, with 55% of women supporting President Obama. Clinton has the potential to grow Democratic support even among women who supported Romney during the last election.</p>  <p>""She is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the Republican Party,"" Brownstein said, pointing to GOP support for the Hobby Lobby case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for Planned Parenthood programs.</p>  <p>Clinton supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare, saying those issues have already resonated with voters.</p>  <p>""I fail to see anyone in the GOP that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as Hillary does today,"" Sefl said.</p>  <p>Message</p>  <p>Recent public remarks from Romney and Clinton give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign.</p>  <p>Clinton has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events, in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme.</p>  <p>""Don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing here today as women's work,"" Clinton told an audience at the Democratic Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. in September. ""We're here proud Democratic women and proud Democratic men, to stand up not just ourselves, not just for women but for all our people - for our families, our communities and our country.""</p>  <p>Clinton also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super PAC Ready For Hillary that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy.</p>  <p>As for Romney, his message could be something like: ""having second (or third) thoughts now?"" On that theme, he told an audience in Colorado this week that President Obama should have taken the terrorist group ISIS more seriously earlier.</p>  <p>""For the president to say, 'Gee, we underestimated ISIS' suggests he wasn't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,"" Romney said. ""I guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations, golf, fundraising. He just hasn't done the job he promised to do.""</p>  <p>A CNN/ORC poll from July found that 53% of Americans would support Romney over President Obama if they could vote again today. (In a hypothetical match up with Clinton, however, 55% would have supported Clinton, with 42% for Romney.)</p>  <p>Romney supporters argue the former candidate seemed prescient on a variety of issues.</p>  <p>""He brings a proven track record of being forward thinking and having the ability to recognize problems and threats before they become a disaster,"" Williams, his former spokesman, said.</p>  <p>But while the upcoming presidential election may center on change, both Clinton and Romney could find themselves talking a lot about their experience.</p>  <p>""You've also got to have people who've actually run something,"" Romney told Fox News in September. ""I don't think Hillary Clinton has that experience.""</p> "

After a pause, he elaborated. ""That's basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.""</p>  <p>Rand Paul: 'I am not opposed to birth control'</p>  <p>Next question.</p>  <p>The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus -- a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda. And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him: burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesn't stray so far from the Republican line that he won't be able to win the party's presidential nomination.</p>  <p>Another student here pressed him on ""the drug war,"" asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He said he wasn't supportive of drug use, explaining that pot ""is not that great,"" but said drug laws should be left up to states. Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana, he said, and we should be watching carefully.</p>  <p>Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit.</p>  <p>His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal.</p>  <p>""Rand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places,"" the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March.</p>  <p>Paul, reared in libertarian politics, found support there because he railed against the National Security Administration's invasive surveillance operations, calling them an absurd violation of privacy. It's his go-to topic when he talks to young people.</p>  <p>Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones.</p>  <p>Soon after, he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee. Paul and his wife, Kelley, danced and sang along to Chumbawamba, the 90s-era pop band with an anarchist streak.</p>  <p>We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of ""Hambycast.""</p>  <p>After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people — as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party.</p>  <p>On the topic of drugs, I picked up where the student left off, wondering if Paul, as president, would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin. He hedged.</p>  <p>""My position has not been for legalization, my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this, and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance,"" he said.</p>  <p>Then I asked about same-sex marriage, something Paul did not touch on in his remarks. Almost 80% of people under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. It's hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with America's youth. And it's not just teenaged and 20-somethings: A clear majority of Americans, 55%, support same-sex marriage.</p>  <p>Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws.</p>  <p>""I don't want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage,"" he told me. ""Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. It is a local issue and always has been.""</p>  <p>But can Republicans win a national election if they aren't in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter? He took a soft tone.</p>  <p>""Society's changing,"" he said. ""I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they're like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it's been rethought. The President's rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.""</p>  <p>It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage.</p>  <p>""The bottom line is, I'm old fashioned, I'm a traditionalist,"" he said. ""I believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don't really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue.""</p>  <p>""You could rethink it at some point, too?"" I asked him.</p>  <p>He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn't a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul's complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.</p> "

While Congress approved legislation before it left for the campaign trail to allow for the arming and training of the rebels, only 42% of Americans favor this action, and 54% oppose it.</p>  <p>Still, there is an undeniable belief among Americans that ISIS poses some level of threat to the United States, with 45% describing it as ""very serious,"" 23% saying it is ""fairly serious"" and 23% noting that it is ""somewhat serious.""</p>  <p>Since the President addressed the nation on September 10 to outline his plan to defeat ISIS, Americans appear more confident in his ability to address the situation. A CNN/ORC poll conducted before his speech showed that 37% of Americans approved of how he was handling ISIS, but this number has now increased to 45%. Overall, 46% of Americans approve of how he is handling the general topic of terrorism, up five points from the CNN/ORC poll conducted earlier this month.</p>  <p>Overall, the President's approval rating remains constant from the previous CNN/ORC poll. Earlier this month, 43% of Americans approved of how he was handling his job, while the new CNN/ORC poll shows that it ticked up one point to 44%.</p>  <p>Keating Holland, CNN's polling director, notes that only 40% of Americans believe the United States is at war with ISIS, which ""may explain why ... his job rating doesn't reflect a 'rally effect' that previous presidents have experienced during wartime.""</p>  <p>In terms of the general mood of the country, 50% of Americans say things are going well, while 49% say it is going badly.</p>  <p>On the five major general themes, Obama rates under 50%: terrorism, 46%; ISIS, 45%; foreign affairs, 42%; economy, 42%; health care 42% -- more signs that Obama could be more hurtful than helpful to vulnerable Democrats seeking reelection in November.</p>  <p>The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International, which interviewed 1,055 adult Americans, by telephone between September 25 and September 28. The sampling error is +/-3 percentage points.</p> "

After a pause, he elaborated. ""That's basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.""</p>  <p>Rand Paul: 'I am not opposed to birth control'</p>  <p>Next question.</p>  <p>The exchange was notable because it happened on a college campus -- a place where Paul has made inroads in building support for his libertarian agenda. And it underscored the challenge that lies ahead for him: burnishing the libertarian credentials that make him so appealing to young voters while making sure he doesn't stray so far from the Republican line that he won't be able to win the party's presidential nomination.</p>  <p>Another student here pressed him on ""the drug war,"" asking if Paul would support legalizing marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He said he wasn't supportive of drug use, explaining that pot ""is not that great,"" but said drug laws should be left up to states. Colorado and Washington are experimenting with legalized marijuana, he said, and we should be watching carefully.</p>  <p>Paul has enjoyed plenty of success on the campus circuit.</p>  <p>His visits to universities from Harvard to Howard have snagged flattering headlines and pats on the back from Republicans who want to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal.</p>  <p>""Rand Paul, Republican presidential hopeful, finds support in Berkeley, of all places,"" the San Jose Mercury News announced after Paul visited in that den of Bay Area liberalism in March.</p>  <p>Paul, reared in libertarian politics, found support there because he railed against the National Security Administration's invasive surveillance operations, calling them an absurd violation of privacy. It's his go-to topic when he talks to young people.</p>  <p>Last March, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Paul blew his opponents away in a presidential straw poll after he brought a ballroom full of 20-somethings to their feet with cries of outrage over government prying into cell phones.</p>  <p>Soon after, he packed a nearby restaurant with fawning college kids at an open bar sponsored by his political action committee. Paul and his wife, Kelley, danced and sang along to Chumbawamba, the 90s-era pop band with an anarchist streak.</p>  <p>We tagged along to the event at the College of Charleston for the latest episode of ""Hambycast.""</p>  <p>After the talk, standing in the sun-splashed campus courtyard, I asked Paul to elaborate on some of the issues that so often put his party at odds with young people — as well as the thorny topics that Paul confronts as he tries to square with small-government libertarian roots with a more dogmatic Republican Party.</p>  <p>On the topic of drugs, I picked up where the student left off, wondering if Paul, as president, would allow a state to legalize a hard drug like cocaine or heroin. He hedged.</p>  <p>""My position has not been for legalization, my position has been for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for people that are caught in this, and that kids who make youthful mistakes should get a second chance,"" he said.</p>  <p>Then I asked about same-sex marriage, something Paul did not touch on in his remarks. Almost 80% of people under the age of 30 support same-sex marriage, according to a Gallup poll earlier this year. It's hard to think of an issue on which Republicans are more out of step with America's youth. And it's not just teenaged and 20-somethings: A clear majority of Americans, 55%, support same-sex marriage.</p>  <p>Paul favors traditional marriage, but has said states should determine their own marriage laws.</p>  <p>""I don't want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage,"" he told me. ""Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. It is a local issue and always has been.""</p>  <p>But can Republicans win a national election if they aren't in tune with rapidly changing opinions on the matter? He took a soft tone.</p>  <p>""Society's changing,"" he said. ""I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they're like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it's been rethought. The President's rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.""</p>  <p>It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage.</p>  <p>""The bottom line is, I'm old fashioned, I'm a traditionalist,"" he said. ""I believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don't really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue.""</p>  <p>""You could rethink it at some point, too?"" I asked him.</p>  <p>He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn't a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul's complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.</p> "

While it's unlikely Romney will run, he's leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign. Meanwhile, of course, everyone is watching Clinton for signs that she might join the race -- and she's doing little to discourage the attention.</p>  <p>The 2016 contest is far from a lock. But if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president, would there be any surprises?</p>  <p>Luckily, with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view, we have an idea of what a Romney-Clinton match up might look like. Here are some areas that would be interesting to watch:</p>  <p>Russia</p>  <p>Critics have faulted Clinton for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia. As secretary, Clinton famously offered her Russian counterpart a ""reset"" button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more.</p>  <p>But President Putin's incursion into Ukraine and his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country's bloody civil war, both of which occurred after Clinton stepped down, have chilled the relationship Clinton hoped would thaw.</p>  <p>Enter Romney, who was mocked after calling Russia the United States' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during an interview with CNN in 2012. At the time, Clinton called his remarks ""dated.""</p>  <p>Romney struck back in an interview with Fox this summer, calling Clinton's reset button ""one of the most embarrassing incidents in American foreign policy.""</p>  <p>Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton's 2008 effort, underlined the former secretary of state's real world foreign policy experience.</p>  <p>""As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a foreign policy record,"" Sefl said. ""I'm not entirely sure what Mitt Romney has besides campaign positions.""</p>  <p>What about gaffes?</p>  <p>Romney famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that Democrats used to paint him as out-of-touch.</p>  <p>From the ""couple of Cadillacs"" he said his wife owned, to the 47 percent of Americans he said were dependent on government, to his offhand remark that ""I like being able to fire people"" who provide bad service, Romney handed opponents an opening.</p>  <p>But while promoting her book ""Hard Choices"" this summer, Clinton made some missteps of her own. The former first lady said she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001. Earlier this year, she told an audience in New Orleans that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of Secret Service concerns.</p>  <p>Were Romney to run again, Clinton's stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns.</p>  <p>A former Romney aide suggested Romney's more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump.</p>  <p>""She's rusty,"" former Romney 2012 spokesman Ryan Williams said of Clinton. ""Gov. Romney has been through two campaigns at this point. He's been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates. She certainly would have a steeper learning curve.""</p>  <p>Clinton has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups. But she hasn't crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like Romney.</p>  <p>That potential advantage could extend to presidential debates. Romney shot up in the polls after surprising President Obama in their first one-on-one debate in October 2012. Clinton hasn't gone through that grueling experience since 2008.</p>  <p>But CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said Romney would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he doesn't understand them.</p>  <p>""It was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant. I still think that's there,"" Brownstein said. ""I don't think Romney gets away from that no matter who he's running against.""</p>  <p>Women</p>  <p>In 2008, Clinton's presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" She continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the State Department and through her family's philanthropic arm, the Clinton Foundation.</p>  <p>Romney struggled with women voters in 2012, with 55% of women supporting President Obama. Clinton has the potential to grow Democratic support even among women who supported Romney during the last election.</p>  <p>""She is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the Republican Party,"" Brownstein said, pointing to GOP support for the Hobby Lobby case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for Planned Parenthood programs.</p>  <p>Clinton supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare, saying those issues have already resonated with voters.</p>  <p>""I fail to see anyone in the GOP that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as Hillary does today,"" Sefl said.</p>  <p>Message</p>  <p>Recent public remarks from Romney and Clinton give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign.</p>  <p>Clinton has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events, in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme.</p>  <p>""Don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing here today as women's work,"" Clinton told an audience at the Democratic Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. in September. ""We're here proud Democratic women and proud Democratic men, to stand up not just ourselves, not just for women but for all our people - for our families, our communities and our country.""</p>  <p>Clinton also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super PAC Ready For Hillary that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy.</p>  <p>As for Romney, his message could be something like: ""having second (or third) thoughts now?"" On that theme, he told an audience in Colorado this week that President Obama should have taken the terrorist group ISIS more seriously earlier.</p>  <p>""For the president to say, 'Gee, we underestimated ISIS' suggests he wasn't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,"" Romney said. ""I guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations, golf, fundraising. He just hasn't done the job he promised to do.""</p>  <p>A CNN/ORC poll from July found that 53% of Americans would support Romney over President Obama if they could vote again today. (In a hypothetical match up with Clinton, however, 55% would have supported Clinton, with 42% for Romney.)</p>  <p>Romney supporters argue the former candidate seemed prescient on a variety of issues.</p>  <p>""He brings a proven track record of being forward thinking and having the ability to recognize problems and threats before they become a disaster,"" Williams, his former spokesman, said.</p>  <p>But while the upcoming presidential election may center on change, both Clinton and Romney could find themselves talking a lot about their experience.</p>  <p>""You've also got to have people who've actually run something,"" Romney told Fox News in September. ""I don't think Hillary Clinton has that experience.""</p> "
"56","Ebola becomes an election issue","CNN.com","2014-10-03 21:52:14","2014-10-05 02:12:35","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/03/politics/ebola-midterms/index.html","Politics"," <p>Top Democratic and Republican campaign officials in Washington are uncertain about the political ramifications of Ebola's arrival in the U.S. and are grappling with how to respond.</p>  <p>But Republicans are seizing on the issue as an opportunity to again make the case that President Barack Obama isn't leading effectively. They're highlighting Obama's recent assurance that Ebola was ""unlikely"" to get to the U.S. and calling for the U.S. to impose new travel restrictions for those countries in Africa where the outbreak began.</p>  <p>It's all part of an effort to force their Democratic opponents to defend Obama's response to Ebola.</p>  <p>GOP officials have reason to believe their line of attack will resonate with voters. CNN has learned from sources at the NRSC, the national campaign organization for Senate Republicans, that the group's internal polling finds 60 percent of voters believe that if a single case of Ebola arises in the U.S., it should be treated as a major crisis by the federal government.</p>  <p>""Washington is broken,"" claimed an NRSC email. ""The top-down approach championed by Democrats for decades (and controlled by them at the federal level in Washington) has shown itself to be completely unprepared and ill-equipped for 21st Century challenges.""</p>  <p>Democrats have been supportive of the administration's efforts, but are pushing for a coordinated effort with other countries to prevent further spread of Ebola. Still, GOP candidates have picked up on the message.</p>  <p>Michigan Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land Friday called for a travel ban or other restrictions to ensure more infected people do not enter the country.</p>  <p>""I'm a mom. I have kids. People are concerned. Again, this is a safety and security issue,"" Land told Michigan Public Radio. She called on the president and her opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters, who she is trailing in most polls, to outline a federal response.</p>  <p>""The President needs to lead,"" Land said. ""Congressman Peters needs to lead -- to come up with a plan to make sure we can deal with this.""</p>  <p>A spokeswoman for Peters told CNN that Land is ""desperate.""</p>  <p>""It is sad Terri Lynn Land is now so desperate that she's trying to use a deadly virus as a political issue, and it's shameful,"" spokeswoman Haley Morris said. ""Before playing politics with such a serious issue, Terri Lynn Land should explain why she pushed for the government shutdown last year, which hampered the CDC and our nation's emergency readiness.""</p>  <p>In North Carolina, Thom Tillis, who is trying to unseat Democrat Kay Hagan in one of the most closely watched Senate races this year, also called for a travel ban from West African countries.</p>  <p>""It's time for Washington to take action to protect the American people,"" said Tillis, who many recent polls show is narrowly trailing Hagan.</p>  <p>A Hagan spokeswoman responded that Tillis's approach would not do enough.</p>  <p>""Kay believes the U.S. should work together with the international community to take a wide range of steps to fight this epidemic and prevent it from spreading,"" Sadie Weiner said in an email. ""Travel restrictions may be one tool we can use, but they should be part of a broader strategy because simply sealing the borders to these countries won't make the crisis go away.""</p>  <p>As far back as August, Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor tried to use the issue of Ebola against his opponent, GOP Rep. Tom Cotton. In a campaign ad, Pryor accused Cotton of voting against a 2013 bill that included money to respond to pandemics. But Cotton did support the final version that became law, according to an analysis by Politifact.</p>  <p>On Friday, Cotton signed a letter to Obama with fellow House Republicans from Arkansas urging him to consider a ban on flights to affected countries.</p>  <p>""The quality of our hospitals, we well as our talented doctors, is undoubtedly a draw for people with the means and will to come to the U.S. -- sometimes because exposure to Ebola in their own country and in spite of the risk to the health of Americans,"" the GOP congressmen wrote.</p>  <p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday that at this point, the Administration is not considering imposing any travel ban.</p>  <p>In an interview on CNN Friday, the number two official with the Senate GOP campaign arm, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, said the U.S. needs to be ""more aggressive"" in screening people coming to the country and pointed to recent report that said the Department of Homeland Security is not equipped right now to deal with a pandemic.</p>  <p>""I don't think we're prepared as we should be,"" Portman said. ""I think this is another example where the administration was not as engaged early on as they should have been and now we're playing catch-up.""</p>  <p>Aides for both the House GOP and Democratic campaign committees tell CNN Ebola has not cropped up in House races at this point. But that could change as political campaigns in recent weeks have been quick to focus their messages on issues that are on voters' minds.</p>  <p>Soon after questions were raised about Obama's response to the terror group ISIS, and public opinion polls showed Americans were increasingly worried about an attack at home, Republican candidates began bringing up the issue.</p>  <p>The National Republicans Congressional Campaign Committee rolled out television commercials suggesting several Democratic candidates didn't support funding to respond to terrorists threats and they were ""dangerous.""</p>  <p>And though Congress is in recess for the final stretch before the midterm elections, a House committee announced on Friday that it will hold a hearing on the Ebola outbreak on Oct. 16.</p> "

Obama had said that it was a fulfillment to his 2008 campaign promise to bring troops in Iraq home. But at the same time, talks to get the Status of Forces Agreement, which provided immunity from prosecution to those troops, were at a standstill due to the internal politics of Iraq.</p>  <p>Panetta, who said he argued behind the scenes and publicly for a small amount of troops to be left for additional training for Iraq's military, was frustrated with White House negotiations on the deal. Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy led the administration's efforts in the heated debate.</p>  <p>""Those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests,"" he said in excerpts of the book released by Time Magazine.</p>  <p>He writes that his views were shared by other military commanders in the region and the Joint Chiefs of Staff but he believes that the Commander-in-Chief could have done more.</p>  <p>""Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one, but without the President's active advocacy, al-Maliki was allowed to slip away. The deal never materialized,"" writes Panetta.</p>  <p>President Obama told CBS's ""60 Minutes"" that former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had ""squandered"" the opportunity to be a thriving democracy with a strong military because he ""was much more interested in consolidating his Shia base and very suspicious of the Sunnis and the Kurds"" than creating a united government.</p>  <p>The president said that sending U.S. troops back into Iraq is not the solution.</p>  <p>""We cannot do this for them, because it's not just a military problem It's a political problem,"" he said on Sunday. ""And if we make the mistake of simply sending U.S. troops back in, we can maintain peace for a while. But unless there is a change in how, not just Iraq, but countries like Syria and some of the other countries in the region, think about what political accommodation means. Think about what tolerance means.""</p>  <p>But Panetta worries that in the meantime the deterioration of Iraq's security has potentially wiped out gains in the fight against terrorism.</p>  <p>""The news from Iraq bothered me to no end. In my view, the ISIS offensive in 2014 greatly increases the risk that Iraq will become al-Qaeda's next safe haven. That is exactly what it had in Afghanistan pre-9/11,"" he writes. ""After all we have done to decimate al-Qaeda's senior leadership and its core, those efforts will be for naught if we allow it to rebuild a base of operations in the Middle East.""</p>  <p>Panetta served as Secretary of Defense from 2011 until 2013.

The idea is not only to counteract recruitment but also to encourage local community intervention efforts before law enforcement has to pursue possible prosecution.</p>  <p>""We have established processes for detecting American extremists who attempt to join terror groups abroad,"" Holder said in a video message posted on the Justice Department's website .</p>  <p>""And we have engaged in extensive outreach to communities here in the U.S. -- so we can work with them to identify threats before they emerge, to disrupt homegrown terrorists and to apprehend would-be violent extremists.

Push ISIS fighters back toward Mosul and farther from Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region.</p>  <p>ISIS had already destroyed a bridge linking the two cities a month ago, hoping to prevent any opposing force from advancing on Mosul -- the country's second largest city.</p>  <p>But the Kurdish fighting force, known as the Peshmerga, found another way, taking a long route around, traveling on dirt roads through mountainous areas -- first north, then west, then back south, past the bridge.</p>  <p>They stopped near villages seized by ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State. Most people had fled or been forced out of the area, the Peshmerga told CNN.</p>  <p>Only fighters for the terrorist group and its sympathizers remained. ISIS, also known as ISIL, has seized large swaths of land as part of its effort to create a caliphate -- an Islamic state -- that stretches from western Syria to eastern Iraq.</p>  <p>Once the Kurdish forces were in place, the firing began -- a series of loud explosions of mortar and artillery, says CNN producer John Fiegener, who along with CNN correspondent Anna Coren embedded with the Peshmerga.</p>  <p>""Then you hear the aerial bombs, and those are bigger. Then you hear the small arms -- the machine guns."" That sound indicates the Peshmerga forces have reached the areas where ISIS fighters are holed up, he said.</p>  <p>It lasted hours.

It caused a ""really huge explosion,"" followed by a ""very large cloud of dust.""</p>  <p>The United States played an instrumental role in the operation Tuesday, with airstrikes that shattered some ISIS positions.</p>  <p>""At least two jets were flying the entire time that we were there,"" Fiegener said.</p>  <p>There were two U.S. airstrikes northwest of Irbil, according to the U.S. military. That's the same area where the Peshmerga operation was underway.</p>  <p>The strikes targeted an armored vehicle and ISIS fighting position, according to the military.</p>  <p>The Peshmerga estimated it faced about 100 ISIS fighters, killing between 20 and 30 of them. Six or seven members of the Kurdish forces were killed in explosions, a commander said.</p>  <p>The Peshmerga did not say whether they had captured any ISIS fighters.</p>  <p>The Kurdish forces took back enough terrain to include the bridge site and nearby villages.</p>  <p>ISIS says it downed Syrian fighter jet</p>  <p>But in Syria, ISIS claimed a victory of its own. The group said it shot down a Syrian military fighter jet.</p>  <p>Photos distributed by the Reuters news agency and the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights show ISIS fighters posing with pieces of what is described as debris from the aircraft.</p>  <p>The observatory, based in London, said the plane was shot down while it was conducting airstrikes on the ISIS stronghold Raqqa, in Syria.</p>  <p>The incident came as world leaders worked to develop strategies to combat the terror group, which claims it has established an Islamic caliphate.</p>  <p>If ISIS is allowed to fester, it will threaten ""our homeland,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel warned Congress on Tuesday .</p>  <p>U.S. strikes close to Baghdad</p>  <p>U.S. military aircraft targeted ISIS positions southwest of Baghdad for a second day.</p>  <p>Three airstrikes targeted ISIS vehicles and weapons, as well as a small ground unit and two small boat on the Euphrates River that was resupplying the extremist fighters, according to the military.</p>  <p>President Barack Obama announced last week that the United States would lead ""a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat"" and that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS would expand from Iraq into Syria.</p>  <p>The United States has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, which has seized control of large areas of northern Iraq and Syria. But it remains unclear exactly which countries are on that list and what roles they'll play.</p>  <p>ISIS put its brutality on display once again over the weekend, posting a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines and threatening the life of another hostage from the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>It was the third videotaped killing of a Western hostage released in less than a month.

And officials say both Ebola and ISIS could grow to become unmanageable problems if action isn't taken now to stamp them out.</p>  <p>Obama's trip, which begins Tuesday, will take him to the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later to the U.S. Central Command at the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.</p>  <p>The President's stop Tuesday at the CDC comes amid loudening criticism from health experts on the global response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where almost 2,500 people have died.</p>  <p>At the U.S. public health agency Obama will be briefed on the outbreak and speak to officials there about how the U.S. is responding. Afterwards he's likely to announce new U.S. commitments in combating the virus' spread, the White House said Monday.</p>  <p>Though officials would not specify how the U.S. may increase its response, steps Obama could announce include sending more medical equipment and U.S. doctors and nurses to combat the virus, and ramping up training for local medical teams.</p>  <p>The Defense Department may also be asked to increase its support in handling logistics of the large-scale response already underway, which involves multiple countries and aid groups.</p>  <p>Epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries aren't sending enough resources to the three nations most affected: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p>  <p>The U.S. has committed more than $100 million in the effort to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Obama plans to call on Congress to approve an additional $88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government.</p>  <p>Last week USAID said it would spend $75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment.</p>  <p>But so far the U.S. aid has been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus, which Obama and White House officials are calling a national security problem. Particularly concerning, U.S. officials say, is the potential for instability in the countries where Ebola is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form.</p>  <p>Ebola currently only transmits though contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to human populations worldwide, health experts say.</p>  <p>Speaking Monday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said there was still a ""very low"" likelihood the Ebola virus could mutate in a way that poses a threat to the United States.</p>  <p>""Right now, the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low, but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States,"" Earnest said.</p>  <p>The potential for increased risk to the U.S. homeland has also inspired the more robust response to ISIS terrorists, who Obama announced last week would be the target of an air campaign inside Iraq and Syria.</p>  <p>That mission is run from U.S. Central Command in Tampa, where Obama will receive a briefing on battle plans Wednesday. The White House said the President would also visit servicemen and women during his stop at the facility.</p>  <p>Obama and his aides maintain that ISIS fighters don't currently pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland but warn of the potential for militants with U.S. or Western passports to return home and stage an attack remains a top concern.</p>  <p>Secretary of State John Kerry has been engaging Arab and European nations in building a coalition to fight ISIS, though levels of commitment from foreign partners has remained vague.</p>  <p>""We're pleased with the level of conversations that we're having with these governments and their willingness to contribute in a tangible, important way to this broader effort,"" Earnest said Monday.

As American commerce began to increase, the Barbary states targeted American merchant vessels that traveled the seas without a strong naval defense.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Ransom payments</p>  <p></p>  <p>Jefferson believed paying ransom to terrorist organizations was a sign of weakness as a nation.</p>  <p>""Some leaders wanted to pay ransom to get hostages back or pay tribute so they [Barbary pirates] wouldn't take further hostages,"" Turner said. ""Jefferson was a lover of peace, but he was not one to believe that peace would be preserved by weakness. We had to show strength.""</p>  <p>In 1801, pirates across the coast of Tripoli continued to seize American ships and use force to take Americans hostage.</p>  <p>""Jefferson learned of how brutally Western prisoners were being held. They were kept in chains, dungeons, their life span was not long, and a lot of them were dying in prison,"" Turner said.</p>  <p>The pirates of Tripoli declared war on the United States in May 1801, according to a chapter written by Turner and published in The Chicago Journal of International Law. Even before his presidency, Jefferson, as secretary of state, argued that his nation should not offer money to terrorists. It's a principle that persists in America's battle against ISIS.</p>  <p>Today, 62% of Americans oppose paying ransom to ISIS, according to a Reuters-IPSOS poll of 4,685 American adults. The U.S. government paid ransom to free Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from the Taliban, but if those type of negotiations are being held with ISIS, it has not been made public. ISIS seems to be making a statement with its hostages.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Congressional vote</p>  <p></p>  <p>In a recent address to the nation, Obama told the American people that we will ""degrade and ultimately destroy ISIS."" Even though he said he didn't need it, he asked for Congress' vote of approval. In the meantime, Obama ordered military strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</p>  <p>A survey released by CNN indicates ""more than seven in 10 Americans think Obama should ask Congress for the ability to strike ISIS militarily. And eight in 10 Americans support Congress approving military force against ISIS.""</p>  <p>But Congress has left Washington to prepare for midterm elections, so any special authority will come after the fact.</p>  <p>In 1801, Jefferson sent a similar message to the American people. Without congressional approval, Turner said, Jefferson sent a small squadron of ships to the Mediterranean to battle the Barbary pirates.</p>  <p>Jefferson ordered naval leaders to ""protect our commerce and chastise their insolence -- by sinking, burning or destroying their ships and vessels wherever you shall find them,"" according to U.S. naval documents.</p>  <p>The first time Congress was officially notified of Jefferson's plan, which deployed two-thirds of America's naval forces into battle with the enemy, was after the fact, in his first annual message to Congress on December 8, 1801.</p>  <p>""Jefferson's belief was that when war is declared against the United States we don't need Congress' approval to fight back,"" said Turner.</p>  <p>In Jefferson's address to Congress he wrote that, ""Unauthorized by the Constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go out beyond the line of defense,"" he deployed American naval forces into battle.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Boots on the ground</p>  <p></p>  <p>With such a strong and pressing enemy threatening the United States, Jefferson eventually sent American naval forces into harm's way to fight.</p>  <p>""I'm a believer. I think we ought to be looking for a way to be getting their [ISIS'] attention. It was a widely held opinion to send ships to the Mediterranean, during Jefferson's presidency, because everyone thought, wow, this is outrageous what they're doing to us,"" Turner said.</p>  <p>Today, Obama faces the pressures of not putting American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. While 76% favor American airstrikes against ISIS, 61% of Americans oppose putting U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria, according to a poll released by CNN earlier this month.</p>  <p>The fight against terror is nothing new for the United States. With many similarities dating back to the early 1800s, today Obama has vital decisions to make. Although the President's strategy to defeat ISIS is gradually emerging, America's ability to grow as a nation emanates from the valuable lessons the country learned so early in its existence.</p> "

In October alone Clinton has four trips planned -- to Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas and San Francisco -- where she will combine a paid speech with either a book event or a fundraiser for a Democratic candidate or group.</p>  <p>The strategy is part logistical, part practical for Clinton. But as she considers a presidential run in 2016, it is also calculated. Campaigning for Democrats in 2014 allows her to curry favor with her party ahead of 2016, while selling her book and speaking to paid gigs lets her raise her profile (not that it is needed) and toy with talking points in front of supportive audiences.</p>  <p>Clinton ended her day Thursday in Florida at the sprawling Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables at a fundraiser for Charlie Crist, Florida's Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democratic candidate for governor.</p>  <p>The event was closed to the press, but according to multiple sources in the room, Clinton both touted Crist as the right choice for governor and spoke about bigger picture issues like the a woman's right to choose, growing the middle class and the importance of the space program to Florida.</p>  <p>The audience responded well to Clinton's fundraising calls, according to those in the room, and a Crist campaign spokesman told CNN that the event raised roughly $1 million for the Democrat's effort. The most expensive table at the event cost $50,000.</p>  <p>Clinton also said, according to one source, that she believed in ""redemption and second chances,"" a remark that was seen as an acknowledgment of Crist's past as a Republican who called on Bill Clinton to resign the presidency during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p>  <p>The former Secretary of State started her day , however, at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, a white washed, swanky establishment were the Clinton was paid to appear before 1,200 people at the Commercial Real Estate Women Network Convention.</p>  <p>The event was announced in May, long before her appearance with Crist was announced last month.</p>  <p>Her speech to the women's group focused almost exclusively on attaining an equal playing field for women in business, sports and politics. Clinton called for paid leave, affordable childcare and equal pay for equal work during her speech -- all issues that would likely make up corner stones of a hypothetical presidential run.</p>  <p>""I believe if we don't dare to compete,"" Clinton told the women, ""we will never know what we are capable of doing.""</p>  <p>She later implored the women in the audience to take risks: ""I cannot tell you how important it is for women like us, all of you and me and other like us, to model that risk taking. To get out of our own comfort zones, to be willing to fail. I have done that, too, on a very large stage.""</p>  <p>The crowd was receptive, with one woman holding up a sign from Clinton's failed 2008 presidential campaign.</p>  <p>""You look beautiful,"" one woman screamed at the start of the speech. ""I think it is a grandmother glow,"" a loose and comfortable Clinton retorted.</p>  <p>Shortly after the event, Clinton and her relatively small traveling entourage whisked across town to Book & Books in Coral Gables to sign copies of her memoir ""Hard Choices.""</p>  <p>While Clinton's book events have become more sporadic than they were over the summer, the Miami event was added long after Clinton's attendance at CREW was confirmed.</p>  <p>Over a thousand well-wishers braved the suffocating humidity and soaking rain to shake hands with Clinton and exchange pleasantries. Outside the event, Ready for Hillary -- the super PAC trailing Clinton to book events -- signed supporters up.</p>  <p>""Looks like there are some teeth coming in,"" proclaimed Clinton when she was presented a toddler. ""Goodness you are well dressed today,"" she joked to a man dressed in a blue stars and stripes sport coat.</p>  <p>As for 2016 -- a question that came up a handful of times -- Clinton dodged and laughed. ""I'm waiting for you to announce, I hope it will be soon,"" said one woman. ""Thank you,"" Clinton responded.</p>  <p>And just like that, after less than 12 hours in Miami, Clinton and her entourage were back to New York. All in a days work for a women who has books to sell, money to make and Democrats to support.</p>  <p>Oh yeah, and a 2016 presidential campaign to consider.</p> "

Cable news outlets, including CNN, Fox and MSNBC, led their news hours during the late afternoon with the story. The story was also featured on the evening news broadcasts on NBC and CBS, and a number of news outlets featured it the next morning.</p>  <p>The news organizations stressed that U.S. officials were spreading doubt on the report. Still, often superimposed banners with messages such as ""U.S Blindsided By Iraqi Terror Warning,"" and ""Officials: No Hint of ISIS Plot Against Subways"" left the viewer unsure what to think.</p>  <p>New York officials, prompted by the report, deployed SWAT teams and K-9 units to the city's subway stations, sent uniformed patrol personnel to check on all 450 stations in the subway system, randomly inspected handbags and luggage and kept officers on duty after their shifts ended. By the next day, heavily armed officers were patrolling subway systems in cities across the country.</p>  <p>All because of a report that had been debunked early on.</p>  <p>Welcome to the Great American Freakout: a time and space where the whole country seems to be infused with, and contributing to, an overriding sense of fear of terrorism in general and ISIS in particular. Despite ISIS not having launched any attacks on U.S. soil and repeated assurances from federal officials that they have not detected evidence of any imminent threats, nearly 60% of respondents in a recent CBS/New York Times poll said they felt ISIS was a ""major threat"" to the United States.</p>  <p>Indeed, a CNN poll taken in mid-September indicated that 71% of Americans felt ISIS already had operatives working inside the country.</p>  <p>While there is little question that ISIS could pose a threat to the United States if left unchecked, some security experts said they believe the current hysteria is overblown.</p>  <p>""It's hard to imagine a better indication of the ability of elected officials and TV talking heads to spin the public into a panic, with claims that the nation is honeycombed with sleeper cells, that operatives are streaming across the border into Texas or that the group will soon be spraying Ebola virus on mass transit systems — all on the basis of no corroborated information,"" Daniel Benjamin, a former National Security Council worker who teaches at Dartmouth College, recently told The New York Times.</p>  <p>But the fear is real and it is palpable and its existence says much, not only about the nature of ISIS, but also about the changes in America politics, media and psychology in the last few decades. This is not to say there are no reasons -- real or imagined -- for Americans to be so afraid. In fact there are at least six.</p>  <p>The video: While the ISIS videos did not show the actual slayings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, they did end with the grisly scene of their decapitated heads lying on their bodies. The impact on the viewing American public was chilling, not just for its barbarity, but also its other worldliness.</p>  <p>""The concept of a beheading is so far out of our normal way of thinking,"" said Donna Fiedler, an associate professor of social work at LaSalle University who has study how psychological trauma affects individuals. ""It's not something we regularly think about or even have in our conceptual maps. So this is something completely new and scary.""</p>  <p>It is also intensely personal. Images of most other terror attacks tended not to show individuals who were being killed or about to die. ""I think we shouldn't underestimate the power of the particular; the power of the individual, said Roy Peter Clark, a senior scholar at the Poynter Institute. ""It's like the little girl in the red dress in 'Schindler's List.' There's death all around her. But you can recognize her as an individual. What that inspires is empathy.""</p>  <p>New media/old media: ""ISIS has proved to be very adept, very talented ... in ratcheting up the hysteria, ratcheting up the image of their influence far beyond what their actual military capabilities are,"" former ""CBS News"" anchor Dan Rather said recently on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Indeed, in producing a steady stream of slickly produced videos that can be downloaded onto smartphones and tablets, ISIS has brought its brutality into the palms of our hands, as well as our living rooms. So whenever someone seeks to play down the threat, evidence supporting it is just a click away.</p>  <p>By giving ISIS saturation coverage, old media has played a role in keeping the public on the edge of its seat with regard to ISIS. In many ways ISIS is an irresistible story for television. ISIS is dramatic. It is mysterious. It is potentially dangerous. It has political ramifications. And it has pictures: the life blood of TV. Battlefield pictures, hostage pictures, scary pictures.</p>  <p>""There's something about the structure of television news that makes small threats big,"" said Brian Stelter, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""It's the graphics and the color and the repetition. Probably the repetition more than anything that makes these guys seem like they're 10 feet tall.""</p>  <p>Partisan politics: This week Scott Brown, the Republican candidate for the senate from New Hampshire, unveiled a commercial accusing the Democratic incumbent, Jeanne Shaheen, and President Obama of failing to adequately protect the country against the ISIS threat. ""Radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country,"" Brown intoned on the ad. ""President Obama and Sen. Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat. Not me.""</p>  <p>A Republican operative told CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh that polling and focus group data indicates that, in the wake of ISIS' emergence, national security concerns are gaining in importance, especially among married women with children. Appealing to these swing voters and to the party's conservative base, which according to polls has shown the most concern about ISIS' terror, GOP strategists feel is a key to victory in the midterm elections. As a result, variations of the Brown ad may soon start appearing across the country. Whether they succeed or not, there is no doubt they will amp up the fear quotient.</p>  <p>Related: Politics of fear invade 2014</p>  <p>They're everywhere! They're everywhere! To hear some tell it, ISIS is an enormous army with fifth columns operating in big cities all over the country. It is more than a little disconcerting to hear that the estimates for the number of ISIS fighters have jumped dramatically from about 10,000 to as many as 30,000. But some analysts note that the first projection was a year old, and that the marked increase in fighters may be ephemeral. ""We have seen that when jihadist groups roll over territory they pick up a lot of riff-raff,"" said Daniel Benjamin. ""A lot of young men join up, mainly to get money to feed themselves every day."" So, if ISIS is forced to retreat, many of these new converts may simply melt away.</p>  <p>What is worrying is the number of foreign fighters in the group. The number of foreigners fighting in Syria is estimated to be more than 10,000. That may sound perilous. But the vast majority of them come from places such as Jordan or Tunisia or Saudi Arabia. A few of these, perhaps only a little more than a dozen, are Americans. ""There are only about a dozen Americans fighting for ISIS and two of them are already dead,"" said Peter Bergen, a national security analyst for CNN. ""There is no evidence that any of the Americans fighting in Syria have been involved in plotting attacks here at home. So I think this particular threat of ISIS is wildly overstated.""</p>  <p>Sure, there are thousands of Europeans, many of them hailing from countries like the United Kingdom and France where visas are not required to travel to the United States. But many are already being tracked by their governments, Bergen said. And to carry out an attack, especially a large-scale one, they would have to travel here, acquire weapons, or produce bomb-making material without arousing suspicion.</p>  <p>Perhaps the most dangerous homegrown problem is individuals who are inspired by ISIS to commit murderous acts, such as Alton Nolen, who allegedly beheaded a co-worker in Moore, Oklahoma. But Nolen, who told police he was ""oppressed"" at work, could have found inspiration from any group that has committed violent acts and received widespread news coverage. There may not be anything special about ISIS.</p>  <p>Perhaps, most important, a number of experts said, there is little evidence ISIS is interested in anything but establishing a caliphate in the Middle East. Unlike al Qaeda, attacks on America do not seem to be a priority, at least for now. ""The key thing is that they are in a fundamentally different business,"" said Benjamin. ""They want to take and hold territory.""</p>  <p>Red line fever: Public fear is always heightened when public faith in their leaders to handle pending crises is shaken. Buoyed by his dispatching of Osama bin Laden, public opinion polls gave Obama high -- or at least passably good -- grades for his handling of foreign affairs into the summer of 2013. Then came the issue of Syria's use of chemical weapons. Having drawn what he himself termed a ""red line"" that the Bashar al Assad regime should not cross with regard to using his chemical weapons, Obama seemed to back away from military action when Damascus crossed it. Even though Syria eventually gave up its chemical weapons, Obama came off in the minds of many as feckless and weak. Public faith in his handling of foreign policy was shaken and has yet to recover. In 2012, a Pew Research Center poll found that 38% felt the President was ""not tough enough"" in his foreign policy dealings. After the Syria chemical weapons affair, 51% of the public, according to a Pew poll, felt that way. In the latest CNN/ORC International Poll, 51% of the public said they do not trust Obama as commander in chief of the armed forces.</p>  <p>With so little faith in the ability of their leader to protect them, it is not surprising that the level of fear has risen.</p>  <p>9/11, CYA: When the second jet slammed into a World Trade Center tower on September 11, 2001, the whole way the country looked at its vulnerability to terrorism changed. But, as much as the public mood changed, it is the shift in the psyche of politicians and governmental officials that is perhaps most important. Having missed obvious signals that could have alerted them to the pending attacks and being hauled before the 9/11 Commission to have their mistakes publicly aired, the political mindset is now don't dismiss any threat -- no matter how inconsequential. Rather than calming the public anxiety, politicians may inadvertently stoke it.</p>  <p>""We know how to ratchet up,"" said Juliette Kayyem, a former deputy director of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and now a CNN contributor. ""It's harder to ratchet down.""</p>  <p>There doesn't seem to be any political price to be paid for overplaying a threat and keeping people on edge. But underplaying one and being wrong could mean the end of a politician's career. ""I haven't seen much of a political downside of putting out even a bogus terror threat warning, even if there is only the slightest possibility there is something to it"" said Philip Shenon, author of ""The Commission: An Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation."" ""Nobody's going to hold you to it.""</p> "
"77","Supreme Court to tackle gay marriage","CNN.com","2014-09-27 12:41:42","2014-10-05 02:14:49","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/26/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage/index.html","Politics"," <p>In just 13 words, the court under Chief Justice Warren Burger dismissed the Baker v. Nelson petition, ""for want of a substantial federal question.""</p>  <p>For about four decades that was the final word on the issue, at least legally. Now a generational shift in public acceptance has given same-sex marriage a powerful new voice. Judges around the country -- in state and federal courts -- have spoken with a near unanimity over the past year that millions of gays and lesbians have been denied an equal protection right to tie the knot, or to have their legal unions recognized by their home states.</p>  <p>Opinion: Marriage equality is not like abortion</p>  <p>The public debate is back at the nation's highest court, with the justices being asked to offer a fresh, definitive, and binding ruling. The court next week will return from its summer recess and meet privately to consider appeals originating from same-sex couples in five states: Utah , Oklahoma, Virginia , Wisconsin and Indiana.</p>  <p>If one or more of those petitions are accepted now for review, oral arguments would likely be held early next year, with a monumental opinion expected by late June 2015.</p>  <p>""The question of whether same-sex marriage bans are constitutional is a historic issue, under the Constitution and for the Roberts Court,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a respected Washington attorney. ""It's hard to imagine a situation where judges are going to have more power to define the social and family relationships of the country.""</p>  <p>A patchwork of state laws on the issue</p>  <p>Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Massachusetts became the first to grant the right in 2004.</p>  <p>A Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage would essentially end a patchwork of state laws -- some that allow it, some that do not, and a few that allow protections short of marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships.</p>  <p>The highest court by its nature is a deliberative body, preferring almost by instinct to take things slowly, allowing issues to percolate in the lower courts and in the political discourse.</p>  <p>Did Obama drop Supreme Court hint? White House says no</p>  <p>Not so here. What has been most remarkable about the issue is how rapidly the core constitutional questions have reached the justices, presenting an inevitability among those on both sides of the debate they will get involved.</p>  <p>The court hurried to schedule the appeals from the five states for its closed-door conference, even before all the legal briefs had been filed. That suggests the justices are ready to add the controversies to the docket, and now.</p>  <p>Some conservative activists say this bench should slow down, and ultimately stay out.</p>  <p>""When the court on such an issue -- where there are very strong opinions on both sides, and a huge issue of social change in our country -- steps in and makes it into a constitutional issue, it makes the justices look significantly more political in the eyes of the American people,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. ""It would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the court ... by imposing one type of solution for the entire nation, instead of leaving it in the hands of the states to decide how they want to address this issue.""</p>  <p>Many supporters of ""traditional"" marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward, and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario. But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does and does not do.</p>  <p>A federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory. And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene.</p>  <p>Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted a ""why wait"" attitude may predominate.</p>  <p>""I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,"" she told the Associated Press in July, referring to state bans on interracial marriage, which was not struck down by the high court until 1967. ""If a case is properly before the court, they will take it.""</p>  <p>In their private conference on Monday-- just the nine justices, no one else attends-- the court will discuss among itself whether to grant a ""petition for a writ of certiorari,"" essentially if any of the marriage cases deserve full scrutiny. It takes just four justices to put such petitions on the docket, but five to ultimately prevail on the merits.</p>  <p>""The stakes are incredibly high for Americans and for the legacy of the Roberts court,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. Moderate-conservative ""Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has been a crucial vote on the question gay rights [in the past], is again expected be a crucial vote in this case.""</p>  <p>The high court's big cases this year</p>  <p>More than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in 31 states</p>  <p>State and federal judges in the past year have ruled 39 times in favor of the expanded marriage right, while two have upheld existing laws. All this follows what the Supreme Court in 2013 said peripherally on the issue.</p>  <p>Fifteen months ago, the justices cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after they ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock.</p>  <p>More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 ""Windsor"" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits, such as tax breaks.</p>  <p>That federal question now morphs into the higher-stakes state jurisdiction, where marriage laws have traditionally been controlled, and where the equal protection issues will ultimately be resolved.</p>  <p>By CNN's count, various individuals and gay rights groups have launched more than 80 pending marriage equality lawsuits in all 31 states with current bans. A Supreme Court review would put all that litigation on hold.</p>  <p>However, the nine justices have complete discretion to stand on the sidelines for now -- and wait for a majority of these state battles to play out, or for a federal appeals court to uphold a ban.</p>  <p>""In theory, the justices can avoid deciding any question, particularly when there is no real division and there isn't about same-sex marriage -- yet,"" said Goldstein. ""But this is just too important. They can't stay out, it would be ridiculous for the nation's highest court not to decide this issue now.""</p>  <p>Strike down same-sex marriage ban s or allow them to stand</p>  <p>The Supreme Court could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or the justices could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing legislatures, voters, or lower courts to sort it all out, for now.</p>  <p>A CNN/ORC International Poll released more than a year ago found an apparent cultural shift: 53% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007.</p>  <p>Some gay rights activists have expressed concern a national legal strategy aimed at the Supreme Court could prove too risky, and end up slowing momentum toward widespread public acceptance of their relationships. A state-by-state approach pursued by some groups had proven gradually successful, and some supporters of marriage equality fear trying to move too far too fast could create legal setbacks, especially when polls continue to show a sizable number of Americans opposed to the idea.</p>  <p>Marriage equality advocates worry about a broader social backlash on other LGBT issues. But those on all sides of this issue recognize it now sits irretrievably in the hands of the highest court, and that is where the next act of this drama is being played.</p>  <p>Nothing about this political and legal debate in the past decade has been easy, predictive or settled. Like the layered dynamic of marriage itself, putting meaning and force into society's expectations remains an ongoing process, a dialogue that continues to evolve in new ways.</p>  <p>Poll: Confidence in Supreme Court at record low</p>  <p>Differing opinions on the Baker case</p>  <p>A final word about the Baker case, the often forgotten pioneer in the fight for LGBT legal rights. The quarter-century after World War II saw many gay and lesbian Americans slowly acknowledging their identity, and facing discrimination and animus as a result.</p>  <p>The 1969 Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village were a social watershed, with many in the LGBT community citing the riots as helping spark the modern fight for equality.</p>  <p>Activists organized and united -- often uneasily -- forging a strategy to have their voices heard in court. They saw how the Supreme Court in particular was moving toward affirming long-denied rights to those based on skin color and gender.</p>  <p>A year after Stonewall, Richard Baker and James McConnell, students at the University of Minnesota, applied for a marriage license in Minneapolis, but were refused. The state's highest court eventually turned aside their appeal, concluding marriage as between one man and one woman for the purposes of procreation and rearing of children was ""as old as the book of Genesis.""</p>  <p>The subsequent refusal by the nation's highest court to intervene tamped down any further legal or political discussion on the issue for decades. The all-male, all-married bench at the time issued a summary decision without full briefing or oral arguments.</p>  <p>Because of the terseness of that decision, state and federal courts today offer differing opinions on whether Baker is ""irrelevant,"" and has any force today when deciding the constitutional equal protection questions.</p>  <p>Minnesota in August 2013 legalized same-sex marriage, the 13th state to do so.</p> "

By November, in another show of force, ""we turned out 87 percent of the Democratic voters in Beaverdale,"" Boggus recalled with evident pride.</p>  <p>After the campaign, Obama's behemoth political organization became Organizing For Action (OFA), but the group has struggled to maintain a coherent identity outside the president's campaigns.</p>  <p>Obamadale, meanwhile, is a small, volunteer-run operation that learned their techniques from Obama campaign officials but has survived and flourished well past the president's re-election fight. Like a political sleeper cell, it is boosting candidates in city council and school board races and playing a key role in this year's closely-watched Iowa Senate race between Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst.</p>  <p>Today, the tightly-knit group of about 20 organizers is one of a handful of Obama-inspired outfits like it across Iowa, an uplifting legacy point for a president who tapped the power of grassroots organizing to win the White House but now struggles with dismal approval ratings and a stalled agenda in Washington. Their talents are already sought out by Democrats thinking about running for president in 2016, and the group is considering whether to throw its weight behind one of them in the Iowa caucuses.</p>  <p>For close watchers of the 2014 midterms , Obamadale is also an emblem of a fearsome and organic Democratic ground game in Iowa that keeps Republican strategists -- who have struggled to keep pace with the Democratic Party's voter turnout machinery -- awake at night.</p>  <p>Related: Hillary Clinton 2016: Fresh start o r deja vu?</p>  <p>Though little-known outside Democratic campaign circles, Obamadale's reputation is so renowned in Iowa that several outside groups working in the state this cycle, including the Ready For Hillary super PAC and environmentalist Tom Steyer's NextGen Climate, have reached out to it for on-the-ground advice. It has also consulted on Democratic races in other parts of the state and worked on issue-based campaigns like a push to get Iowans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.</p>  <p>""Those guys know how to win elections,"" said Brad Anderson, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state and the Iowa state director for Obama's 2012 campaign. ""What's really impressive about Obamadale is they are deeply passionate about the issues and they have been for a long time now, but they understand more than most the strategy of political campaigns, and the importance of phone-calling and door-knocking and election law and person-to-person contact.""</p>  <p>A grassroots political f orce</p>  <p>What's also remarkable about Obamadale is that it thrives independently of the state's Democratic Party infrastructure, even as it consults with the official party on strategy. It is as much a social club as a political operation, deeply embedded in the Beaverdale community and intensely loyal to one another. It IDs voters and secures early voting ballots, but Obamadale members also swap recipes, go to church together, help out when someone is sick and even take road trips together, including a 1,000-mile winter drive from Des Moines to Washington for the president's 2013 inauguration.</p>  <p>""On a campaign you'll be in a phone bank, and it's a big room of people you don't know,"" Boggus said. ""Here, I know the person, I know their story. They are the reason I come back all the time. I miss them if they aren't around in some way. It's 100% because of Obama.""</p>  <p>Beaverdale is a working-class place, mostly white, heavily Catholic and rowed with picket fences and ""Beaverdale Bricks,"" small neo-Tudor homes that have made the community a draw for young families. Though only a short distance from bustling and resurgent downtown Des Moines, Beaverdale feels like its own quaint Midwestern hamlet, where neighbors chat after work in their front yards and gather in family-owned restaurants at night.</p>  <p>The Obamadale members hail from different backgrounds and professions. One is a librarian, one a county health worker, one an office manager. Several are retired.</p>  <p>""What's great about them is they aren't just a bunch of 25-year-olds,"" said Scott Brennan, the Iowa Democratic Party chairman. ""It's an interesting mix of folks that crosses demographic lines and socioeconomic lines. But they are people who are completely committed to the President and committed to Democratic politics.""</p>  <p>With no defined budget, Obamadale members fund their operations out of their own pockets, work out of donated office space at a local law firm and rely on the owner of Tally's, a Beaverdale watering hole that serves a memorable ground-bacon-and-beef burger, to open up the restaurant for Democratic campaign rallies and volunteer meetings.</p>  <p>Door-to-door canvasses are launched off the outdoor deck of Saints Bar and Grill, another Obamadale-friendly establishment in the neighborhood. Events and GOTV pushes are usually coordinated on Obamadale's Facebook group, or by phone or text.</p>  <p>People pitch in when and where they can. ""Some people don't like to call or canvass, but are more than willing to do postcard writing,"" said Tammy Keiter, a program manager at the Polk County Public Health Administration.</p>  <p>John Judge, a mustachioed human resources director who has lived in Beaverdale for 26 years, said that his wife, also a Democrat, ""was reluctant to be a part of it, but she got involved because she liked the people.""</p>  <p>""We have her doing data now,"" he said.</p>  <p>Before a State of the Union watch party in January, amid below-freezing temperatures, Judge helped Reno haul a flat screen television and speakers from his basement across several icy streets into Tally's for the president's speech. It was barely 10 degrees outside, but over 110 people showed up.</p>  <p>""If we don't have at least 100 people in attendance for an event, even at short notice, it's a failure,"" Reno said. ""That's kind of our performance standard.""</p>  <p>Their energy and loyalty to one other is admirable, but Obamadale's most prized asset, for ambitious candidates, is their impressive ability to identify and turn out voters in one of the state's biggest Democratic hubs.</p>  <p>It's why then-congressman Braley wrote a personal letter to Boggus in 2012 thanking her for her work, and why Anderson held a rally inside Tally's on the day he announced his campaign, and why Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is laying groundwork for a presidential campaign, stopped by Saints during a June visit to Iowa to make nice with the Obamadale crew. They gave him a bag of Iowa-shaped chocolates from Beaverdale Confectionary, and Boggus promptly posted a picture of the visit on Facebook.</p>  <p>""Any candidate running in Iowa would benefit from having them in their corner, no doubt,"" Anderson said.</p>  <p>Building on Democratic campaign lists collected over the years, including some of the vaunted Obama campaign voter files obtained during the 2012 race, the Obamadale bunch runs its own data and field programs. Boggus and Reno won't put an exact number on how many voters are in their database from Polk County and other parts of the state, but they say it reaches well into the thousands.</p>  <p>They are quick to attribute their tactical knowledge to the Obama campaign's volunteer training efforts, and the field marshals of the Obama campaign look at them, and similar groups nationwide that adopted the lessons of 2012, like proud parents would.</p>  <p>""We invested in and trained the members of our grassroots movement on real skills,"" said Jeremy Bird, the Obama campaign's national field director and an original architect of their volunteer operations. ""It's no surprise they're now paying it forward and putting everything they learned about building people-focused, data-driven, digitally-savvy campaigns to work to support Democrats up and down the ticket in their home communities.""</p>  <p>But because of Obamadale's local relationships, its work on other races and the mom-and-pop nature of its outfit, the group says its voter intelligence in the Des Moines area is more granular and sophisticated than the larger-scale voter lists of the Obama campaign or the Iowa Democratic Party.</p>  <p>""I definitely think we learned a lot from the (Organizing For America) team model and it influenced our structure, but we went beyond it,"" says Reno.</p>  <p>In addition to phone numbers, emails and voting history, Obamadale organizers know who has soccer practice on what day, who has health issues or who might have a pesky Republican whispering in their neighbor's ear — whatever factor might influence how and when a person might vote.</p>  <p>Friends and work colleagues look to them for political tips as well.</p>  <p>""A woman on my street told me, 'I always wait for whatever sign you put in your front yard because I know who to vote for,'"" Judge said. ""I mean, she is a college-educated, young professional. But most people are not obsessed with this stuff like we are.""</p>  <p>The Obamadale organizers have day jobs, but they sound like David Plouffe or Jim Messina when talking about the efficiencies of their political program.</p>  <p>""When you see these lists that come from the VAN"" — the Democratic Party's voter file software — ""they are not the most accurate,"" Boggus said. ""So we keep our own database of people. They are tiered up. Tier one is our core group of people, about 20 of us. Tier two, they were a little more sporadic with volunteering. Tier three, they will come to events only. Tier four, they don't want to have anything to do with volunteering, but they vote, and we make sure they do early vote.""</p>  <p>Early voting and vote-by-mail, which begins here on Thursday, was decisive in Obama's 8-point victory over Mitt Romney in Iowa in 2012. The campaign tapped their vast field organization to bank tens of thousands of Democratic votes before November, a bonanza that neutralized Republican turnout on Election Day.</p>  <p>Schooled on the same principles, Obamadale is currently making an early vote push in Des Moines aimed at boosting Braley and other Democrats, like 3rd District congressional candidate Staci Appel and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jack Hatch.</p>  <p>""Every good Democrat that we have ID'd for our candidates, we're going to have their vote in the bank,"" Reno said. ""We are only going to be worried about a very small number of our IDs on Election Day. And the people who traditionally have trouble getting to the polls, we are going to get them there.""</p>  <p>Want to be president? Talk to this guy</p>  <p>Hillarydale? And other 2016 c hoices</p>  <p>The next presidential race is on their minds, too.</p>  <p>Over glasses of wine at Tally's last weekend, on the eve of Hillary Clinton's visit to the Harkin Steak Fry, members of Obamadale hashed out their opinions on the likely Democratic field. Clinton, they agreed, was the 2016 frontrunner, though they complained that she was miscast as cold and distant by the media. Clinton was somebody they all said they would consider supporting, but everyone wanted to see a competitive caucus campaign.</p>  <p>""I want to see as many people come through Iowa as possible,"" Boggus said. ""We saw in 2008 that you can be a little-known guy with a funny name and not very much money and do amazing things because you have a ground game.""</p>  <p>They gushed over O'Malley, who visited with the crew this summer. ""I love him,"" said Boggus, who was spotted at the steak fry the next day proudly waving a ""Ready for Warren"" placard in support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive darling from Massachusetts.</p>  <p>""If Elizabeth Warren and Hillary were sitting at different tables at a place like this, most people would go over and talk to Warren,"" said Ben Guise, a retired state employee.</p>  <p>Reno would not rule out supporting one of the presidential candidates, though he said the decision ""would have to respect everybody's ownership of the group."" He said candidates would have to prove their grassroots credentials by stepping out of their comfort zones and listening to voters up close. Stopping by an Obamadale-run event or two wouldn't hurt their cause, he said.</p>  <p>""Honestly, we are doing this for free,"" Reno said. ""And so would have to decide who is worthy of our effort before we get behind them. We are all volunteers. Candidates need to justify the effort we give them, which includes being accessible and respecting how grassroots groups like ours can add some sanity to electoral process, by helping neighbors talk to neighbors in even-minded tones about the issues.""</p>  <p>As for the name, it seems like Obamadale is here to stay. Braleydale and Hillarydale, they said, don't roll off the tongue as easily.</p>  <p>""We are deeply loyal to the President,"" Reno said.</p> "
"80","Why does GOP fight early voting?","CNN.com","2014-10-02 15:05:04","2014-10-05 02:14:53","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/01/opinion/brazile-early-voting-rights-ohio/index.html","Politics"," <p>These two reasons are why I'm outraged by what's going on in Ohio.</p>  <p>This week, the Supreme Court, on the eve of early voting, ruled that efforts by Ohio Republicans to restrict early voting days were acceptable . This gets rid of what's called the Golden Week in Ohio -- the period when voters can register and cast their ballot at the same time.</p>  <p>It ended convenient voting hours, when Ohioans could vote after a long day at work -- as late as 9 p.m. It also ended voting on one of the two Sundays before Election Day when many folks head to their polling place after church. These have been hallmarks of the Ohio voting system, but the Supreme Court and Republicans have yet again changed the rules in the middle of the game -- all to create barriers between people and the ballot box.</p>  <p>And unfortunately it's not just Ohio where Republicans have doggedly tried to restrict or cut early voting days or hours. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP have reduced and limited the early voting period , including weekend voting. In North Carolina , the Republican governor and legislature took away a week of early voting. And in Georgia, a GOP legislator lamented a county's move to expand early voting , saying he would ""prefer more educated voters"" over black early voters.</p>  <p>Think this doesn't have any real impact? Think again. In 2012, a third of voters cast a ballot before Election Day , in person or by mail -- more than double the rate during the 2000 election. All told, more than 18 million voters cast an early in-person ballot when President Obama was re-elected.</p>  <p>Voting shouldn't be a challenge. It should be as easy and accessible as possible. We shouldn't require forms of ID that folks don't have, we shouldn't restrict days or hours that allow working people a chance to both do their job and exercise their democratic right, and we damn well shouldn't be throwing up new obstacles midstream.</p>  <p>When obstacles are thrown up, we should have protections for voters. That's why I was so frustrated when the Supreme Court last summer gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder.</p>  <p>The Supreme Court ruled that there's no need for national oversight when localities and states with a history of racially discriminatory voting laws make voting rule changes. I'm not alone with my frustration. A recent poll from Lake Research and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights found that nationally, 69% of the American public favors restoring the VRA, with only 10% opposing.</p>  <p>Voters of both parties, all races, and every region across the country favor a congressional proposal to restore the Voting Rights Act. I'm hopeful that Republicans and Democrats will, in the lame duck session after the 2014 elections or in the beginning of the next session of Congress, hammer out legislation that restores oversight and protects voters.</p>  <p>As Democrats, we believe in giving every eligible citizen the opportunity to vote -- whether it's early because they can't take off work on Election Day or absentee because they might have plans to be out of town. And we believe this for two reasons. First, when more people vote, Democrats win. That's because more Americans agree with us on the big issues and the big questions -- like who's got my back? But second, it's because our democracy is better when more people have skin in the game. Our democracy relies on participation and we've never done better by excluding folks.</p>  <p>If there's one thing we can count on, it's that the GOP is going to continue to come up with last minute schemes to make it more complicated, more confusing, or just plain more difficult for honest, hardworking citizens to vote on Election Day or before.

I'm talking about the brawl between what are usually ideological allies. Conservative vs. conservative, liberal vs. liberal.</p>  <p>On the left, the Obama administration, the Department of Education and Secretary Arne Duncan are scrapping with allies in the teachers' unions. On the right, pro-accountability education reformers are battling supporters of local control who think the federal government should butt out of the education business.</p>  <p>This war won't be won or lost in boardrooms, classrooms or conference rooms but in the worlds of politics and public relations. You might have a powerful idea to reform the education system. But if you don't spend the time, money and effort fashioning an effective communication strategy to sell it, you're toast. You can't bring a policy paper to a Twitter fight.</p>  <p>Take Common Core.</p>  <p>You might think the word ""common"" describes the shared success that we'd like students to have. If you take underperforming schools and less-demanding curricula in some states and raise them to a level where they compare to higher-performing schools in states with more demanding curriculum, you give students a ""common"" experience. For the disadvantaged, this is a good thing.</p>  <p>But for those parents who are happy with the education system and content with the product, the word ""common"" can be terrifying. They worry about a one-size-fits-all process that holds back high achievers so all students in different schools and different states get the same level of education, even if the results students have in common are mediocre.</p>  <p>Here's a quiz about one of the most controversial -- and poorly marketed -- stabs at education reform in recent years.</p>  <p>Common Core is ...</p>  <p>a. A good and harmless idea that has been unfairly maligned by a small band of critics on the left and the right.</p>  <p>b. A reasonable concept that has been poorly executed and terribly communicated by the elites who devised it.</p>  <p>c. A nonsensical method of teaching that reeks of a big government and corporate takeover of the public schools.</p>  <p>d. A gigantic ""fail"" that is taking on water faster than the Titanic after the ship hit the iceberg.</p>  <p>e. All of the above.</p>  <p>The answer is e. Wait, that doesn't make sense.</p>  <p>Exactly. That is precisely what the opponents of Common Core say about, for instance, its meandering method of teaching math. Equations that could once be solved in two steps now take six or seven.</p>  <p>The sad part is that the idea was good to begin with: develop a common curriculum that outlines what students should know at every grade level so that students attending different schools in different states get roughly the same education.</p>  <p>What good does it do society to have a high school diploma in Mississippi that doesn't compare to one in Massachusetts?</p>  <p>Forty-five states and the District of Columbia signed on to Common Core right out of the gate a couple of years ago, and the federal government provided grant money. But not long thereafter, 10 states -- including Indiana, Oklahoma, Missouri and Iowa -- dropped out. More are likely to follow.</p>  <p>All of this seems familiar.</p>  <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Americans grappled with ""new math,"" a dramatic change in how math was taught in elementary schools that was prompted in part by the federal government's desire to ratchet up teaching of math and science. Some complained and thought traditional ways of teaching math were better.</p>  <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Americans were rattled again when they were introduced to ""whole language"" instruction as a new way of teaching students to read by encouraging them to think strategically about the meaning of words, phrases and sentences in their entirety. Again, there were critics.</p>  <p>Now, here we are again: at each other's throats over a concept that many people don't even understand. There are lessons in this debacle for both sides.</p>  <p>Common Core supporters can't concoct a new national curriculum and then fail to effectively communicate what they did, why they did it and what effect it's going to have on kids. Politics is a reality. Learn to navigate it, or stay out of the arena. And elitism and condescension are better repellents than bug spray.</p>  <p>Opponents have to shelve the ""look out for No. 1"" approach to education. Americans are part of a collective with public roads, public libraries, public schools. How other people's kids are doing in other states is your problem, just like, one day, paying for your Social Security and Medicare will be theirs.</p>  <p>I hope that the people behind the new curriculum have learned some humility and are ready to show us why we should listen to them. And I hope more states stick with the Common Core and give it another chance.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine .</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

Barack Obama have in President Barack Obama. Earlier this year, one in four Democrats and two in three Independents said this administration has let them down, according to a CBS News/New York Times Poll .</p>  <p>It seems once the euphoria of 2008 wore off, voters were shocked to learn the country's first black president wasn't as radical as his election. He's shown himself to be idealistic but methodical. A compassionate figure with a thing for drones and kill lists.</p>  <p>These days, he is thinking legacy. But what will history say about the man who was voted into office with a mandate to end the war in Iraq and now will likely leave that office with a new war in Iraq trailing behind?</p>  <p>As the bombing in Syria by the United States, and to a lesser extent, a cadre of allies, was getting under way, Obama delivered a thoughtful address to the United Nations on Wednesday.</p>  <p>He called out Arab nations that ""accumulate wealth through the global economy, and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down."" He dared to challenge Muslims to reject those who rally around a bastardized version of the Islamic faith and then use that doctrine to justify chaos. He spoke of a crossroad between ""war and peace,"" ""disorder and integration,"" ""fear and hope.""</p>  <p>Remember that word? Hope.</p>  <p>It was the word Obama used to ignite the movement that would lift him from his position as a little-known junior senator from Illinois into the White House and onto the world stage. He promised to change the way things had always been. Now Moore and others are disappointed because they believed him.</p>  <p>After winning the Iowa Democratic caucus in January 2008, Obama told the rabid crowd that the country was choosing unity over division and that ""this was the place, this was the moment where America remembered what it means to hope.""</p>  <p>Six years later, a Gallup poll found fewer Iowans approve of the job Obama's doing than the national average -- 38% to 43%. What will history say about the man who encouraged immigrants to dream big and then left them hanging for the sake of the midterm election? Who has overseen 54 consecutive weeks of private-sector job growth, the longest stretch in history. Who pledged to close Guantanamo Bay. Who OK'd the mission that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden. Who promised to be transparent.</p>  <p>In 2007, Oprah Winfrey gave a speech in support of Obama. She said, ""We need a new way of doing business in Washington, D.C. and in the world. ... I'm tired of politics as usual."" And yet here we are.</p>  <p>George W. Bush left Afghanistan and Iraq for Obama to sort through, and now it is likely Obama will leave behind Iraq and Syria for his successor.</p>  <p>Opinion: America's wartime president</p>  <p>At the U.N., Obama explained in detail why it was important to defeat ISIS. Instead of a soaring delivery, he spoke plainly about the choices that lie in front of us all, intelligently shifting the point of emphasis from destroying terrorist groups to derailing their instruments of recruitment, funding, and their very philosophy. ""No God condones this terror,"" he said.</p>  <p>""There can be no reasoning -- no negotiation -- with this brand of evil,"" he said. ""The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.""</p>  <p>And then he reiterated that he is prepared to lead in this force for the remainder of his presidency.</p>  <p>It was the kind of rhetoric we were accustomed to hearing from his 2008 opponent, Sen. John McCain, who has yet to see a war he didn't want us to be a part of. It was the kind of rhetoric his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, said would make him the better leader.</p>  <p>It was the kind of rhetoric that has become as much a part of Obama's complicated legacy as the Affordable Care Act, the rise in LGBT rights and the slow, but real, economic recovery.</p>  <p>Syria now becomes the seventh predominantly Muslim country in which he has authorized military strikes. Perhaps his earlier persona contributed to his resistance to do so sooner, despite the advice of his inner circle. When one takes power under the guise of a peaceful change agent, one should pause before ordering airstrikes, if for no other reason than not wanting to contribute to the Earth's carnage.</p>  <p>But for the next two years, he is committed to doing just that. He doesn't have much of a choice, really. Terrorists are reportedly developing articles of clothing that explode. I shudder to think what will be in store for airline passengers dealing with TSA screenings if such a thing comes to pass.</p>  <p>How will history remember Obama? What will his legacy be? It appears a lot of that will depend on how many people the U.S. kills before he leaves office.</p>  <p>That's not why many of us voted for him, but I guess the rest of the world didn't get the memo. We voted not to bomb people. To end the wars. To stop spying.</p>  <p>I wonder if he's as disappointed in the way things have turned out as the rest of us.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

The warrant provided no other details, but Lt. Carl Minden with the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said Lewis was a suspect in the disappearance of Beverly Carter.</p>  <p>Carter went to show a home in the small community of Scott on Thursday. She then vanished.</p>  <p>Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay told reporters Monday morning that his investigators were questioning Lewis. When asked whether the suspect was talking, Holladay said: ""We will have to see how cooperative he is as the day progresses.""</p>  <p>Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police while he was a person of interest in her disappearance.</p>  <p>Suspect was in wrec k</p>  <p>Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office.</p>  <p>Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident, and ""Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,"" the report says.</p>  <p>Another witness told police that ""the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,"" according to the report.</p>  <p>Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says.</p>  <p>At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Minden said.</p>  <p>""While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,"" the lieutenant said in a statement.</p>  <p>The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said.</p>  <p>Dozens of volunteers -- as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They resumed their search Monday in two areas in the southern part of the county, the sheriff said.</p>  <p>""At this point we don't know where she is,"" Holladay said.</p>  <p>The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said.</p>  <p>The Sheriff's Office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties.</p>  <p>Official: Agent's c ell phone used</p>  <p>The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case.</p>  <p>Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he ""knew something was wrong.""</p>  <p>Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said.</p>  <p>Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the Sheriff's Office.</p>  <p>There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Later he explained to HLN's Nancy Grace that included text messages, but he declined to elaborate on the nature of the texts.</p>  <p>Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris.</p>  <p>""I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,"" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. ""She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her.""</p>  <p>The elder Carl Carter told CNN affiliate KARK-TV that ""I would just like to have my wife back.""</p>  <p>The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon.</p>  <p>Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement.</p>  <p>He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said.</p> "

Jury selection began Monday morning. The retrial will follow and is expected to last about two weeks.</p>  <p>Before jury selection began, Davis' parents, Ron Davis and Lucia McBath, were outside the Duval County Courthouse, along with Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teen killed by a neighborhood watch captain earlier the same year.</p>  <p>""This trial speaks to me because I am that family,"" Fulton said. ""The family that's missing a son. I'm the family that's a victim of senseless gun violence. That's the purpose of me coming here, that's just to stand with the family, to be with the family and to show the support.""</p>  <p>About 40 people gathered demanding justice for Jordan Davis as well as other slain African-Americans, including Emmett Till, Rodney Mitchell and Karvas Gamble Jr. Protesters carried signs that said ""Justice 4 Jordan"" and ""Is it OK to murder me because I like loud music?""</p>  <p>A pastor led the group in prayer before Davis' parents entered the courthouse. The gathering promptly dispersed, but not before McBath thanked the crowd for supporting her son.</p>  <p>""We just want to thank the country and thank you all for the wonderful support and prayers that you've given us these last two years. We could not do this without you. We're very grateful for every moment that we've been on your minds and your hearts,"" McBath said.</p>  <p>She added, ""Whatever verdict we receive, we will be humble and abide by. But the verdict and the justice that we seek will always and will only come from God.""</p>  <p>Defense attorney Waffa Hanania expressed concern to County Court Judge Russell Healey that the rally, which ""appears to be sanctioned by Mr. Davis' family,"" could influence potential jurors.</p>  <p>Healey responded that there is ""only so much I can control,"" but conceded that ""it's not helpful to us getting a jury here in Jacksonville."" He said that the court would determine what potential jurors heard and saw when they're questioned.</p>  <p>The first tria l</p>  <p>Earlier this year, on what would've been Davis' 19th birthday, a Jacksonville, Florida, jury found Dunn guilty on four of five counts in the case.</p>  <p>While Dunn said he shot into a Dodge Durango full of teenagers in self-defense, he was convicted on three counts of second-degree attempted murder -- one each for firing at Davis' pals, Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes and Tevin Thompson -- and one count of shooting into a vehicle.</p>  <p>The attempted murder convictions alone carry a cumulative minimum sentence of 60 years in prison for the 47-year-old Florida man.</p>  <p>Opinion: Why prosecutor is retrying 'loud music' murder case</p>  <p>The 12 jurors, however, deadlocked on the final and most serious charge: premeditated first-degree murder.</p>  <p>Dunn claimed that after a heated argument over loud music at a Jacksonville gas station, Davis threatened him and Dunn thought he saw Davis produce a gun or lead pipe.</p>  <p>Though Davis had a knife in his pocket, police recovered no weapons matching Dunn's description, and his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, testified that Dunn never mentioned seeing a weapon.</p>  <p>Following the argument, Dunn pulled out a handgun and began firing. He continued firing even as Stornes, the driver, put the Durango in reverse and retreated, witnesses said.</p>  <p>Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV. Three of those bullets hit Davis, one piercing his liver, lung and aorta.</p>  <p>'... they didn't call 911'</p>  <p>After the shooting, neither Dunn nor Rouer called police. They drove 40 miles to a bed and breakfast in St. Augustine, and once there, defense attorney Cory Strolla said, Dunn took his dog for a walk and Rouer ordered a pizza and movie.</p>  <p>""They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,"" Assistant State Attorney John Guy said during the first trial. ""That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep.""</p>  <p>Asked why he never called police, Dunn said, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why.""</p>  <p>In the morning, Rouer watched a news report about the shooting and the two then drove another 130 miles home to Satellite Beach where Dunn was apprehended.</p>  <p>What happened in the hours after the shooting may play a role in the new murder trial, as prosecutors must prove that Dunn planned to kill Davis. In the first trial, prosecutors alleged that Dunn's actions after the shooting were indicative of his intent, an assertion Dunn's defense attorney denied.</p>  <p>Davis' father, Ron Davis, was certainly struck by Dunn's actions after killing his son and expressed satisfaction in February that Dunn would face a lengthy prison bid.</p>  <p>""He is going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son, that it was not just another day at the office. My son will never be just another day at the office where (Dunn) can leave the scene and be stoic,"" he told reporters.</p>  <p>Awaiting sentencing</p>  <p>Dunn has not yet been sentenced on the original counts. In addition to the 60-year minimum he faces on the attempted murder charges, he could spend another 15 years in prison on the count of shooting into a vehicle.</p>  <p>While his new defense attorney, Hanania, hasn't been speaking to media, Strolla has said his client would appeal the original verdict.</p>  <p>That may explain why -- even though, pending appeals, Dunn could spend the rest of his life in prison -- prosecutors are preparing for another highly publicized trial on the murder charge.</p>  <p>To hear prosecutor Angela Corey tell it, it's about justice.</p>  <p>""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" she said after the first trial in February.</p>  <p>CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said he can see how some people might think it defies logic to try the case again, but from Davis' parents' perspective, it makes all the sense in the world.</p>  <p>""If he winds up with 60 or 75 years in jail, from a pragmatic standpoint it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to retry the case,"" Callan said after the first trial.</p>  <p>""On the other hand if you're the parents of Jordan Davis and you believe, as well you should, that your son's reputation has been besmirched by this self-defense claim, the family (might) want a retrial, and that's something that a prosecutor has to consider carefully.""</p> "

A third defendant, former plant quality control manager Mary Wilkerson, was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice.</p>  <p>The Parnell brothers, Moore said, ""could easily spend the rest of their lives in prison.""</p>  <p>Both men were taken into custody pending sentencing. Bond was set at $150,000 for Stewart Parnell and $100,000 for his brother, Moore said. A sentencing date has not been set.</p>  <p>Stewart Parnell's lawyer, Thomas Bondurant, said he will appeal the verdict.</p>  <p>""We think it was the wrong decision and we will continue to fight on behalf of Stewart Parnell,"" he said.</p>  <p>Jeff Almer, whose mother, Shirley Almer, died after she ate peanut butter that came from Parnell's processing plant, Peanut Corp. of America, said he felt relief as the clerk began to read the verdict. He had prepared to hear the worst -- that the Parnells would be acquitted. Instead, he heard the word ""guilty"" over and over again.</p>  <p>""It was validation,"" said Almer, who traveled from Minnesota to Georgia for the trial. ""It was emotional.""</p>  <p>After about the 14th ""guilty,"" the words began to fade and Almer thought of his mother, who died four days before Christmas in 2008.</p>  <p>""I don't think these people are devils,"" he said, ""but they let greed take over their morals.""</p>  <p>Food safety lawyers also applauded the jury's decision.</p>  <p>""If anybody deserved it, he did,"" Minnesota-based trial lawyer Fred Pritzker said of Stewart Parnell.</p>  <p>""I am not at all surprised he was found guilty given the evidence against him,"" said Pritzker, who represented some of the victims of the outbreak.</p>  <p>Federal prosecutors presented more than 1,000 documents and called 45 witnesses to the stand to make their case that Parnell, his brother and Wilkerson cut corners on safety in order to make a bigger profit for Peanut Corp. They were accused of covering up lab results that tested positive for salmonella in their peanut products.</p>  <p>The prosecution's blistering opening statement contained three now-infamous words Stewart Parnell penned in a March 2007 email to a plant manager about tainted products: ""Just ship it.""</p>  <p>Defense statements and witnesses, which took all of 104 minutes, portrayed Parnell as a small business owner who was scapegoated by the government.</p>  <p>At one point, the jury was shown a photograph of peanut butter made at Peanut Corp. sitting on Parnell's dining table at home. Defense attorneys said Parnell would not have had the peanut butter in his own home had he known it to be compromised.</p>  <p>The trial opened August 1 in Albany, Georgia, less than an hour's drive from the Peanut Corp. plant in the small town of Blakely, raided and shuttered in 2009 by federal food inspectors.</p>  <p>The 2008-2009 salmonella outbreak killed nine people, sickened at least 714 others nationwide and resulted in a huge food recall that cast a pall over one of America's favorite foods: peanut butter.</p>  <p>Food safety advocates said the trial was groundbreaking because it's so rare corporate executives are held accountable in court for bacteria in food.</p>  <p>Never before had a jury heard a criminal case in which a corporate chief faced federal felony charges for knowingly shipping out food containing salmonella.</p>  <p>Pritzker praised public health officials whose sleuth work eventually traced the outbreak's origins back to the Peanut Corp. plant in Blakely.</p>  <p>""I don't view (Parnell's) conduct as any different than poisoning people or drunk driving,"" Pritzker said. ""My strong suspicion is that this happens much more often than is known.""</p>  <p>However, Parnell and his co-defendants were not on trial for poisoning people or causing any deaths stemming from the outbreak, and prosecutors did not mention the deaths to the jury.</p>  <p>Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who also represented several victims of the outbreak, said the government would have had the added burden of proving the deaths were linked to Parnell had they mentioned them. Those facts were not necessary, Marler said, to prove the charges at hand.</p>  <p>Marler said he hopes Friday's verdict will send a message to corporations that they cannot get away with this kind of behavior.</p>  <p>The prosecution was unprecedented, Marler said, because the Department of Justice charged the Parnell brothers with felonies. Prior cases involved misdemeanors.</p>  <p>""Prosecutors took a risk and fortunately, the jury believed them,"" Marler said. ""The jury saw this for what it was. The emails and documents told a story of a company that was more interested in shipping out products than products that were safe.""</p>  <p>Salmonella is America's most common cause of foodborne illness and sickens up to 1.4 million people every year.</p>  <p>Former employees of Peanut Corp. described filthy conditions at the Georgia plant. Federal inspectors found roaches, rats, mold, dirt, accumulated grease and bird droppings during their raid. They also found a leaky roof.</p>  <p>Salmonella is often associated with meat, poultry, eggs and raw milk -- products from animals that are carriers of the bacteria.

The case puts constitutional questions about double jeopardy squarely under the spotlight.</p>  <p>It all began in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1985. Hennis, who was then a 27-year-old Army soldier based at nearby Fort Bragg, visited the home of Kathryn Eastburn and her husband, Gary, a captain in the Air Force. The Eastburns were planning to move outside the country and had placed an ad in the newspaper to sell their dog. Hennis stopped by the house in response to the ad.</p>  <p>Four days later, when neighbors became concerned, police entered the home to find the bloody bodies of Kathryn Eastburn and two of her daughters. The youngest Eastburn child, a 22-month-old girl named Jana, was found in the house alive. Police said Gary Eastburn was undergoing training in Alabama at the time of the killings.</p>  <p>Hennis came forward to police when he heard on TV news that authorities were looking for a man who visited the house in response to a newspaper ad.</p>  <p>Investigators had been gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. A witness named Patrick Cone said he was near the Eastburn home the night of the killings and saw a tall white man wearing jeans, a knit cap and a Members Only jacket leaving the Eastburns' driveway with a trash bag. A police artist drew a sketch based on Cone's description. Prosecutors said the sketch resembled Hennis. Police put Hennis in a line up, and prosecutors said Cone identified Hennis as the man he saw.</p>  <p>In 1986, his first trial</p>  <p>Police arrested Hennis and in 1986, prosecutors put him on trial. They said his motive was sex.</p>  <p>The theory was that ""Hennis' wife was out of town, he had a new baby and so he decided to make a pass at a married mother of three -- and that didn't go well,"" former local reporter Scott Whisnant told CNN's ""Death Row Stories."" Whisnant had covered the case in depth for Wilmington's Morning Star newspaper.</p>  <p>Gary Eastburn told police several items were missing from his home, including an envelope of cash, an ATM card and the Eastburn account password. Police said the ATM card was used to withdraw $150 twice over two days.</p>  <p>Prosecutors said Hennis was behind on his rent, which was about $300. He paid his rent the Monday after the killings, prosecutors said. A woman who used the same bank ATM shortly after the Eastburns' ATM card was used told investigators she saw a man nearby matching Hennis' description.</p>  <p>During the trial, prosecutors showed jurors gruesome police photos to illustrate their case. The jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced Hennis to death.</p>  <p>While on death row, Hennis received a mysterious, anonymous letter in the mail: ""Dear Mr. Hennis,"" the letter said. ""I did the crime, I murdered the Eastburns. Sorry you're doin the time. I'll be safely out of North Carolina when you read this. Thanks, Mr. X""</p>  <p>The letter's author was never determined.</p>  <p>A second chance to prove his case</p>  <p>Hennis' lawyers appealed his case to North Carolina's Supreme Court, where judges ruled that the graphic police photos had wrongly influenced jurors to render a guilty verdict. The ruling allowed Hennis a rare second chance to prove his case in a retrial.</p>  <p>Compared with the first trial, Hennis' defense attorneys engineered a complete 180 on their strategy. After exhaustive preparation, they attacked many of the prosecutors' most damaging accusations one by one. They discredited the prosecutors' star witness, Patrick Cone, and his testimony. He had testified that the weather was clear the night of the killings, but another witness said it was overcast.</p>  <p>A new defense witness who looked similar to Hennis testified he was walking in the neighborhood at the time of the killings.</p>  <p>The witness, John Raupaugh, ""lived down the street from the Eastburns,"" Whisnant told ""Death Row Stories."" ""He was an uneasy sleeper and had a habit of walking the neighborhood at 3 in the morning. He often wore a beanie hat and he had a black Members Only jacket."" Raupaugh's testimony, defense attorneys said, gave jurors the reasonable doubt they needed to acquit Hennis in 1989.</p>  <p>Escaping death row as a newly freed man, Hennis then re-enlisted in the Army, eventually retiring in 2004 as a master sergeant.</p>  <p>But prosecutors continued to pursue the case.</p>  <p>In 2006, vaginal swabs from a rape kit taken from Kathryn Eastburn's body yielded new evidence. DNA testing was an imperfect science in the 1980s, so the semen found in Kathryn Eastburn's vagina wasn't pursued as evidence during the first trial. But by the 2000s, technological advances in DNA analysis had improved. Experts said the DNA from Eastburn's rape kit was consistent with Hennis' DNA.</p>  <p>U.S. Army steps in</p>  <p>A team of military attorneys evaluated the case and the Army decided to pursue it. Hennis was recalled to active duty two years after his retirement and promptly arrested on three counts of murder.</p>  <p>""Tim Hennis is the only person in United States history who's been tried for his life three times after guilty and not guilty verdicts,"" said Whisnant, whose book ""Innocent Victims"" was made into a 1996 TV movie.</p>  <p>Many observers were surprised. Wasn't Hennis shielded by constitutional protections against so-called double jeopardy?</p>  <p>""In the simplest terms, if a defendant is acquitted and the prosecutor says to the judge, 'I want a do-over,' that is clearly prohibited. That's the definition of double jeopardy,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""But if a different prosecutor in a different court comes up with a different way to frame charges in the same crime, then that is generally permissible.""</p>  <p>Maj. Rob Stelle of the Army Judge Advocate General Corps, who worked on the Hennis case, told ""Death Row Stories"" that the military's ability to prosecute a case that has already been tried is ""well-settled law. Nothing the state does actually effects what the federal government can do.""</p>  <p>""In a very narrow category of cases where the federal government believes an injustice has been done, then federal prosecutors will step in,"" Toobin said. ""But by and large, they operate in separate spheres.""</p>  <p>When it came down to it, the prosecution's case in Hennis' court-martial hinged on the DNA testing results.</p>  <p>""The sperm found in the vagina of Mrs. Kathryn Eastburn is the person who raped and slaughtered her and her children. And that's Timothy Hennis,"" Maj. Matt Scott, another Army JAG attorney who worked on the case, told ""Death Row Stories.""</p>  <p>The jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced Hennis to death. He now sits in solitary confinement on death row at Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas, awaiting appeal.</p>  <p>But many unanswered questions remain. ""There's a ton of physical evidence in that house that they can't explain,"" Whisnant told CNN's ""Death Row Stories.""</p>  <p>A head hair was found in the Eastburns' bed that is not Hennis', Whisnant said. Unidentified DNA was found under Kathryn Eastburn's fingernails. ""We should be running that DNA against our known database,"" Whisnant said. ""Let's find out what happened.""</p>  <p>It likely will be a long time before the final page is written in this bizarre murder mystery.</p>  <p>Even after the appeals process is over, Hennis cannot be executed without presidential approval. In recent years, that hasn't happened very often. The U.S. military has not executed anyone from its ranks since 1961.</p> "

""</p>  <p>Read the U.S. Court of Appeals opinion on the case (PDF)</p>  <p>His experience raises nearly every issue that shapes America's capital punishment debate: DNA testing, mental retardation, a jailhouse snitch, incompetent defense lawyers, prosecutorial misconduct and ""a strong claim of innocence,"" said author Raymond Bonner , who wrote about the case in ""Anatomy of Injustice: A Murder Case Gone Wrong.""</p>  <p>In other words, a prime example of when ""innocence is not enough,"" Bonner said.</p>  <p>Elmore would probably still be on death row if not for Diana Holt, who began investigating his claims of innocence in 1993. When Holt met Elmore, she was surprised that a convicted killer on death row could be ""so docile and gentle.""</p>  <p>Two post-conviction review courts rejected Elmore's claims, though one noted that he ""may well not be guilty."" But Holt never considered giving up.</p>  <p>""If I throw in the towel, a client dies. If I stop working, they stop breathing,"" Holt said. ""Sometimes, I am the first person who ever stuck by them or treated them with respect.""</p>  <p>A bloody crime scene</p>  <p>Elmore was arrested in January 1982 for the rape and murder of Edwards, a wealthy widow in Greenwood, South Carolina. Edwards' longtime neighbor and friend, Greenwood City Councilman Jimmy Holloway, told police he let himself into her house after noticing newspapers piling up in her driveway.</p>  <p>Inside the house, he discovered her bloody corpse in a bedroom closet and alerted police. Holloway also identified Elmore, who had cleaned Edwards' windows and gutters the month before, as a possible suspect.</p>  <p>Within 48 hours, police arrested Elmore based on a thumbprint found on Edwards' back door. By April, a Greenwood County jury had convicted Elmore of murder and sentenced him to death. It would be the first of three times he would stand trial in the case, followed by years of appeals and post-conviction reviews.</p>  <p>When Holt took on the case, she says, she discovered a disturbing chain of events that led to Elmore's conviction, starting with law enforcement's willingness to build a case around Holloway's timeline. From there, Elmore's lawyers say, prosecutors suppressed blood and fingerprint evidence that could have cast doubt on their case. Instead, Elmore's lawyers claim that prosecutors deliberately introduced falsely incriminating statements from a jailhouse informant and hairs from Elmore that were not found at the crime scene.</p>  <p>A breakthrough finally came in 2011, when the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Elmore's conviction and ordered a new trial, based partly on findings that Elmore's trial lawyers blindly accepted the prosecution's case without bothering to examine the evidence in his first trial and retrial.</p>  <p>""A healthy skepticism of authority, while generally advisable, is an absolute necessity for a lawyer representing a client charged with capital murder,"" a judge wrote in the majority opinion. ""Elmore's lawyers disregarded their professional obligation to investigate critical prosecution evidence, thereby engendering 'a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.' ""</p>  <p>'Couldn't believe my eyes'</p>  <p>None of it would have come to light if not for Holt. She was in her mid-30s when she joined the case the summer before her third year of law school. Her journey to law school had been hard-fought, with a history of abusive relationships and a stint as a teen serving time in a Louisiana prison for armed robbery.</p>  <p>At 28, she began taking community college classes and earned the grades to enter Southwest Texas State University. Given her past, Holt was pleasantly surprised when the University of Texas accepted her law school application in 1991.</p>  <p>Her professors nudged her in the direction of death penalty litigation when she began to show a knack for the persistent digging the job demands. Through internships at the Texas Resource Center, Holt met lawyer John Blume, executive director of the South Carolina Death Penalty Resource Center. During an internship there, Blume asked her to help with Elmore's case by interviewing jurors.</p>  <p>""I started reading the trial testimony and couldn't believe my eyes,"" Holt said. ""All the forensic evidence evaporated under the smallest measure of scrutiny.""</p>  <p>She became immersed in the case, ""all Elmore, all the time,"" and ""classes became more like an annoying distraction,"" she said. Blume offered her a job as a staff attorney once she graduated, but she couldn't wait and moved to South Carolina before the final spring semester, for ""Elmore and John Blume,"" she said, half-joking.</p>  <p>A few things about the case jumped out at her.</p>  <p>For one, police said they had seized pubic hairs from Edwards' bed and identified them as belonging to Elmore.</p>  <p>If that was true, Holt wondered, where were crime scene photos of those hairs on the bed? Why weren't they packaged like other evidence taken from the scene? Why didn't investigators collect the bedsheets for further analysis? Elmore conceded that hairs introduced into trial evidence belonged to him but claimed that police pulled them from his head and groin area after his arrest.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, fibers and hairs collected from Edwards' body and marked ""item T"" on an evidence log were never introduced into evidence. For years, the state claimed they were missing, until 1998, when they were found in the private office of an investigator in the case. Testing revealed a ""Caucasian pubic hair inconsistent with Mrs. Edwards"" that Elmore's team claims could have cast doubt on the state's theory that he was the only possible killer.</p>  <p>Holloway's ""farcical"" trial testimony also led Holt to question his portrayal by prosecutors as a shocked neighbor and longtime friend. When Holt interviewed Holloway in 1993, within five minutes, she said, he told her, ""I am the only one who could kill her and get away with it, the way she trusted me so.""</p>  <p>Holloway died in 1994.</p>  <p>And yet, when Elmore walked out of prison in 2012, he was not fully exonerated.</p>  <p>Elmore agreed to a deal with prosecutors that allowed him to maintain his innocence while pleading guilty. In exchange for pleading guilty to murder, the state dropped a burglary charge and agreed to a 30-year sentence with credit for time served.</p>  <p>In the 2012 hearing, prosecutor Jerry Peace said that the state still believed it had a strong case against Elmore but that the victim's daughter supported the plea as a means of ending the case.</p>  <p>Read more about the plea deal (PDF)</p>  <p>Holt, however, told the court that his defense team believed Elmore is ""100% innocent"" but also sought to end the case. He could have gone to trial, but she has seen other clients wait years for a retrial. She also would have preferred an all-out acquittal, but ""immediate freedom stymied ongoing justice,"" she said.</p>  <p>""That the justice system provided an avenue for an immediate release to freedom for Mr. Elmore that was previously not available to him is more justice than injustice,"" she said. ""Justice was better served with his freedom.""</p>  <p>If you were in Elmore's shoes, would you plead guilty to a crime you did not commit, in orde r to get out of prison?

""The evidence in this case has led us to this point today. Whether it leads us to anyone else remains to be answered.""</p>  <p>The next step will be to put Harris' case on Superior Court Judge Mary Staley's arraignment calendar, which should happen within three weeks, the prosecutor said. Motions will then be filed before the case goes to a trial calendar.</p>  <p>Reynolds declined to take questions or comment further, saying, ""This case will be tried in a court of law,"" and not in the media.</p>  <p>If Reynolds seeks the death penalty, it will be for the malice murder charge, which alleges that Harris , who has claimed his son's death was an accident, premeditated the child's killing.</p>  <p>Harris' attorney, H. Maddox Kilgore, called the charges excessive, describing them as a part of the ""state's maze of theories.""</p>  <p>""It was always an accident. When the time comes, and we've worked through the state's maze of theories at trial, it's still going to be a terrible, gut-wrenching accident. And all the eccentricities and moral failings of Ross' life isn't going to change that,"" he told reporters.</p>  <p>The other five charges Harris faces are: first-degree cruelty to children, second-degree cruelty to children, criminal attempt to commit a felony (sexual exploitation of a minor) and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors.</p>  <p>According to the indictment, the grand jury found that on June 18, Harris ""did unlawfully, and with malice aforethought, cause the death of Cooper Harris ... by placing said Cooper Harris into a child car seat and leaving him alone in a hot motor vehicle.""</p>  <p>The two felony murder charges allege that Harris killed his 22-month-old son while committing the felonies of first- and second-degree cruelty to children. One count states he killed Cooper ""maliciously,"" while the other felony murder count says Harris killed him ""with criminal negligence.""</p>  <p>Harris faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted on any of the murder charges.</p>  <p>By leaving Cooper in the car, Harris caused the boy ""cruel and excessive physical pain,"" the cruelty to children charges allege.</p>  <p>The criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to Cooper's death. They involve allegations that Harris requested a nude photo of a minor's genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of ""sexual excitement and sexual conduct,"" according to the indictment.</p>  <p>A Cobb County detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while Cooper was in the car at his father's workplace, Harris was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them, who was underage, a photo of his erect penis.</p>  <p>Harris pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in June. Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox signed off on the charges, stating Harris would've had to notice that ""the stench in the car was overwhelming"" when he got in it as he left work and ""drove it for some instance"" before stopping to check on the boy.</p>  <p>Charges filed in an indictment supersede the previous charges. Harris has been held without bond since Cooper's death this summer.</p>  <p>Authorities have painted Harris as a terrible father who, after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child, purposely strapped his son into his sweltering SUV to die.</p>  <p>His motivation? The prosecutor has characterized Harris as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life.</p>  <p>Kilgore has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car. Friends described Harris as a doting dad, not a malicious one, who loved to show off his blond, bright-eyed boy and talked about him incessantly.</p>  <p>It all started simply enough: Harris left home with Cooper in a rear-facing car seat in the back of his 2011 Hyundai Tucson, then headed to his job as a Web developer for Atlanta-based Home Depot after making a quick stop at a fast-food restaurant for breakfast.</p>  <p>But he didn't follow through on his routine of stopping to drop the boy off at daycare.</p>  <p>Instead, according to a criminal warrant, Harris drove to work and left Cooper strapped in his car seat. He went back to his SUV during lunch, put something in the car, then returned to work.</p>  <p>All the while, the vehicle got increasingly hotter, with records showing the temperature topped 92 that day -- which can make the heat inside a closed vehicle soar past 100 degrees quickly.</p>  <p>Sometime around 4:15 p.m., seven hours after he'd arrived at work, Harris got back into his Hyundai and left work. Witnesses told police that, soon thereafter, they heard ""squealing tires (as) the vehicle came to a stop"" in a shopping center.</p>  <p>Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at the probable cause hearing that Harris got out of the car yelling, ""Oh my God, what have I done?""</p>  <p>He then stood with a blank look, going to the other side of his SUV to make a phone call after someone told him that his son needed CPR, a witness told police, according to Stoddard.</p>  <p>Witness Leonard Madden testified that, upon leaving a restaurant, he noticed Harris was distraught and crying.</p>  <p>""He was hollering,"" Madden testified, recounting the father saying, ""Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My son is dead!""</p>  <p>Harris had to be physically restrained once it became clear Cooper wouldn't make it -- at which time it was 88 degrees -- according to police.</p>  <p>Leaving his son alone in the car wasn't the only thing Harris did that day, authorities say.</p>  <p>While at work, he messaged six women besides his wife and exchanged explicit texts with some of them -- including the lewd photo that he sent to an underage female, Stoddard testified.</p>  <p>Yet even after these allegations surfaced, his wife Leanna Harris stood by her man.</p>  <p>She sat calmly through the probable cause hearing, and at Cooper's funeral flatly insisted she was ""absolutely not"" angry with her husband.</p>  <p>""Ross is and was and will be, if we have more children, a wonderful father,"" Leanna Harris said at the funeral in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a gathering that her husband also addressed via phone from the Cobb County Jail. ""Ross is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household. Cooper meant the world to him.""</p>  <p>Given the district attorney's comments Thursday about whether anybody else will be charged in connection with the case, the attorney for Leanna Harris said he was surprised Reynolds was still contemplating charges.</p>  <p>""I am surprised that the district attorney is still contemplating after almost three months of reviewing the evidence whether or not to charge my client, if that is who he was referring to in his press conference,"" attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said.</p>  <p>""By now, I would think they would have been able to make a final decision and clear her from any wrongdoing.""</p> "

The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney's office told CNN it has no comment on the lawsuit.</p>  <p>The suit -- which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and battery -- details circumstances allegedly surrounding several arrests between August 11-13:</p>  <p>-- Tracey White was about to buy an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers ""in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and sticks and wearing helmets"" entered and ordered her to leave, according to the lawsuit. She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticizing officers for the way they were treating her son, the lawsuit claims.</p>  <p>-- Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges. He fell into a creek or sewer, the suit says, where officers ""pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned.""</p>  <p>-- Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, ""took out his memory card and threw it to the ground,"" the lawsuit says.</p>  <p>-- Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green were peacefully protesting, the lawsuit says, when police in riot gear fired tear gas and what appeared to be stun grenades in their direction, then ""hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time.""</p>  <p>CNN has not independently confirmed details of the arrests.</p>  <p>Police tactics to calm the crowds drew sharp criticism, including a rebuke from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.</p>  <p>""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said as the protests unfolded.</p>  <p>As criticism of police tactics mounted, Gov.

That approach, he said, was much better than using nightsticks or dogs.</p>  <p>Even though President Barack Obama has called for a review of military equipment sales to local police departments in light of the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Belmar said that such equipment is often necessary.</p>  <p>""I never envisioned a day that we would ever see that kind of equipment used against protesters,"" he said.

What would state and federal authorities have to prove in order to pursue charges? And does the fact that the gunman was a police officer change how the case could play out?</p>  <p>Here's a look at what legal analysts say could happen next.</p>  <p>Was a state crime committed?</p>  <p>A local grand jury has started hearing testimony, but that doesn't mean any particular charges are being recommended by prosecutors at this point, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.</p>  <p>""An investigation is just an investigation. ... It's just something that they're looking into,"" Toobin said.</p>  <p>For a criminal case to go forward, the grand jury must decide whether a crime was committed, and whether it's more likely than not that the accused person -- in this case, Wilson -- committed the crime, said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor.</p>  <p>After a fatal shooting, a range of charges are typically on the table, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, a criminal defense attorney. ""They're going to be anything in the spectrum of murder, manslaughter (or) negligent homicide,"" he said.</p>  <p>The prosecutor will make a recommendation to the grand jury.</p>  <p>From there, the grand jury could decide to indict Wilson, or that there isn't enough evidence to move forward. In order to bring charges against Wilson, nine of 12 jurors will have to agree.</p>  <p>But the prosecutor plays a key role in the hearings, which are not open to the public.</p>  <p>""The grand jury ultimately decides whether to indict, but it's 100% the prosecution's show. ... The prosecutor could, in theory, make less of an effort if he doesn't want someone indicted,"" Cevallos said.</p>  <p>Some residents and community leaders contend St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases.</p>  <p>J.Tom Morgan, a former district attorney in Georgia who knows McCulloch, defended him as fair and objective.</p>  <p>""I believe Mr. McCulloch will present the facts and the evidence to the grand jury and the Missouri law as he is required to do so,"" Morgan said. ""We do not put defendants on trial just to see what a jury will do.""</p>  <p>Were Brown's civil rights violated?</p>  <p>As part of a federal civil rights investigation, authorities are interviewing witnesses and weighing a number of factors.</p>  <p>Key among them: whether Wilson exhibited ""racial hostility,"" Toobin said.</p>  <p>""The most important thing would be, did he say anything that indicates racial hostility, either before, or after, or during (the shooting)?"" Toobin said.</p>  <p>Wilson is white, and Brown was African-American.</p>  <p>""The bar is very high,"" Hostin said, ""and they're difficult cases to prove.""</p>  <p>But race doesn't have to be a factor in the shooting for investigators to allege there was a federal civil rights violation, Cevallos said.</p>  <p>Federal statute says it's a crime for government officials ""to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution.""</p>  <p>Federal prosecutors could argue that Brown's right to life was violated, Cevallos said, but it's a tough case to make.</p>  <p>""They have to show that the officer intended to deprive somebody of that constitutional right. They would have to show intent to kill...which is not a particularly easy showing to make,"" he said.</p>  <p>When can police use deadly force?</p>  <p>The fact that Wilson is a police officer could influence whether he faces charges -- and how the case plays out.</p>  <p>""Often jurors are extremely sympathetic to police officers,"" said Paul Butler , a professor at Georgetown University Law School and a former federal prosecutor. ""They think, even if he made a mistake, he's got the hardest job in the world, so they often want to cut police officers some slack.""</p>  <p>Authorities also weigh different factors when deciding to prosecute police.</p>  <p>""There are issues that come up when you're prosecuting cases against police officers, because police officers by the very nature of their jobs can use deadly force,"" Hostin said.</p>  <p>Police officers have the same rights civilians have to self defense, Cevallos said, and they also have the right to make arrests.</p>  <p>""To do that,"" he said, ""they can use deadly force to prevent an escape.""</p>  <p>If Brown was trying to get away from the officer, Cevallos said, the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner allows the use of deadly force when an alleged felon is trying to flee if ""the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.""</p>  <p>But given the number of times Brown was shot, along with newly released audio that may show a pause in rapid gunfire, Wilson has a lot of explaining to do, the analysts said.</p>  <p>""Evidence suggests that he wasn't fleeing and was facing the officer,"" Cevallos said. ""If that's true ... the officer has to explain six shots. He has to explain a reason for each of those six shots. He has to have justifiably been in fear of his life or fear of some imminent serious bodily harm.""</p>  <p>Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests</p> "

""I decided no more violence. I didn't want my son to see him treat me that way.""</p>  <p>She left him two years ago and moved into her own place. She mostly kept the ordeal to herself until she found the courage to express herself in the Monument Quilt, a collection of hundreds of survival stories touring the country this summer.</p>  <p>Her words in Spanish are etched into a 4-foot red square that shares space with others' stories in a 16-foot square. When laid out in full, the squares of 250 stories of surviving rape and abuse stretch out to a 100-foot multicolored square.</p>  <p>""You told me that you loved me but now I know and I understand that I was raped,"" she says. ""I was your wife, not your property.""</p>  <p>The brainchild of Baltimore-based activist group "" Force: Upsetting Rape Culture ,"" the Monument Quilt project is making 13 stops in 12 states, displaying portions of the quilt in public spaces and growing its footprint through quilt-making workshops.</p>  <p>The goal of the project is to create healing spaces by and for survivors, said Rebecca Nagle, co-founder of Force.</p>  <p>The quilt evolved from discussions about how to create a permanent monument to survivors of rape, similar to memorials for war veterans, based on research showing how public monuments can help survivors recover from trauma, she said.</p>  <p>Quilting has a long history connected to social justice movements, perhaps most notably through the AIDS Memorial Quilt , which began touring the country in 1988 in remembrance of those who succumbed to the disease.</p>  <p>Nagle hopes bearing witness to the quilt will help erode stigma attached to rape, similar to the effect the AIDS quilt had on raising awareness around the disease.</p>  <p>""When we remove the stigma from rape and we're able to have public conversations and not blame the survivor, it's one step closer to curbing the epidemic.""</p>  <p>The presence of the quilt transforms parks, sports fields and town squares into reverential spaces for grieving and reflecting, said Karen Taylor, a Baltimore social worker who volunteers for Force.</p>  <p>""It creates a community holding space instead of the burden of trauma being on the shoulders of each individual supporter or survivor,"" Taylor said. ""It can be solidifying and reassuring. It can be lifting. It's not just on you anymore.""</p>  <p>Part of the healing comes from the collective impact of bearing witness to hundreds of survival stories. It also comes from creating the squares, some of which starts in workshops weeks before the Monument Quilt comes to town.</p>  <p>Force partnered with community-based prevention and public safety organizations, who made the quilt workshops part of their community outreach. South Dakota's White Buffalo Calf Women Society hosted workshops two weeks in advance of the quilt's arrival in White River, where it was displayed at a local high school.</p>  <p>Quilting is a cultural tradition of the Sioux tribe that inhabits the region, making it an ideal project for the community the shelter serves.</p>  <p>""It gave them a voice without putting them in the spotlight and I think that in itself was very powerful, and a good way to start the healing process,"" education outreach coordinator Summer Lunderman said.</p>  <p>""To stand in solidarity not only with our relatives here but with women in the U.S. was also very empowering for them and let them know they're not alone.""</p>  <p>Helping others with their squares brought up memories of Lunderman's experience being molested as a child. Her square reads, ""Lakota Women Are Sacred.""</p>  <p>""It created a safe space for me that I really needed.""</p>  <p>Witnessing the quilt inspired Baltimore activist Melanie Keller to bring to the surface her own history of being raped. Keller helped organize workshops through her work with anti-street harassment organization "" Hollaback! BMore ."" But she has never publicly identified herself as a rape survivor.</p>  <p>Too often stories of sexual harassment in the media focus on stranger danger, date rape or the experiences of white middle-class college students, she said. Seeing the diversity of experiences represented in the quilt inspired Keller, who is biracial, to make her own square.</p>  <p>""What I love about the whole project is the narrative of control by survivors,"" she said. ""It speaks to the diversity of different experiences who have gone through abuse and rape because we're the ones sharing those stories in the way we choose.""</p>  <p>Moreno says creating her square was cathartic. She hopes sharing her story will inspire others to ""free"" themselves of a despair she knows firsthand.</p>  <p>""Reading these words tells you yes, there is an opportunity to break the cycle of violence,"" she said.

She exhaled the smoke through a fan vent in the basement bathroom of her home, sometimes at 2 a.m., so her children wouldn't smell anything.</p>  <p>""There's such a stigma about heroin, that it's dirty and it's IV users under the bridge and homeless people, and that is so not the case,"" Scudo said. ""Heroin crosses all borders, all socioeconomic groups.""</p>  <p>Scudo's addiction was far from unique. The path from prescription drugs to heroin is well traveled, according to Dr. Patrick Fehling, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Hospital's Center for Dependency, Addiction and Rehabilitation.</p>  <p>""That is very common. I have a lot of patients that ask me, 'Are prescription opioid painkillers gateway drugs towards heroin?'"" Fehling said. ""Absolutely.""</p>  <p>Scudo's drug use, while extreme, shouldn't obscure one reality: ""Prescription drug abuse is a massive problem in the United States,"" Fehling said.</p>  <p>How it began</p>  <p>For Scudo, her addiction began -- as they all do -- innocently enough.</p>  <p>She sought relief from hip pain, possibly caused by scarring from cesarean sections she had delivering several of her children.</p>  <p>Her then-husband recommended a physician.</p>  <p>""There was no physical therapy offered,"" she said of the doctor's visit. ""The first reaction was, let's give you some drugs.""</p>  <p>He put her on OxyContin.</p>  <p>By the second week, she was physically addicted.</p>  <p>She was popping so much of the painkiller and other drugs such as anti-anxiety Valium that they equated to a dosage for three men.</p>  <p>A second doctor reduced her prescription, causing Scudo to experience withdrawal symptoms, or become ""dope-sick.""</p>  <p>""When you start withdrawing from opiates, it focuses in your lower back and your legs, and it is like somebody has clamped a vice on both sides of your hips and is just smashing you. Hitting my back with a baseball bat would have been more comfortable,"" Scudo said.</p>  <p>She was desperate for more OxyContin.</p>  <p>""Some people are not addicts and can take drugs as prescribed,"" she explained. ""But for the few people who are addicts, it's a whole different ball game.""</p>  <p>To feed her cravings, Scudo leveraged her maternal authority: She found drug dealers who were friends of her eldest children.</p>  <p>""When you have eight children,"" she said, ""you're bound to know people.""</p>  <p>It was so easy.</p>  <p>But it was also so expensive. One OxyContin pill cost $80 on the street.</p>  <p>""One OxyContin wouldn't last me at all,"" she said. ""I could never take just one OxyContin. That wouldn't even keep the dope-sick away.""</p>  <p>So she turned to heroin.</p>  <p>Why?</p>  <p>Her fear of withdrawal was greater than her fear of the drug.</p>  <p>Living fearlessly</p>  <p>Like OxyContin, heroin was abundant on the street. In Denver. In the suburbs.</p>  <p>Once you bought from one dealer, several more approached you, she said.</p>  <p>She bought seven balloons -- or seven grams -- of heroin for $100, she said. That kept her high for up to three days.</p>  <p>""I would do some crazy stuff to get drugs,"" she said. ""Like 2 o'clock in the morning, I'm making a run to downtown Denver. Like picking up my grandkids in the car (to go to a drug deal), praying that I was not going to get busted.""</p>  <p>No risk was too great.</p>  <p>Never did she think of what she had to lose.</p>  <p>""Not once,"" she explained. ""That's the addict in me.""</p>  <p>After almost 10 years of heroin addiction, she wondered how much her family knew. Her children stopped bringing the grandchildren to visit her. She pawned family heirlooms. Her second marriage failed, and she stole from her ex-husband.</p>  <p>""I know they knew that I was struggling, but they didn't know how to help. I'm sure that they were scared to death for me,"" she said, ""and the sad part is...I didn't care.""</p>  <p>She fooled herself. After all, she was good at lying. Her job was going well. The bosses promoted her a few times. Everything was manageable, except when she got home from work at 4 p.m. and was in bed for the night at 4:30 p.m.</p>  <p>""I didn't want to think. I didn't want to feel. Actually I didn't care if I lived or died,"" she said.</p>  <p>The only person she couldn't fool was her alcoholic mom in recovery, who noticed Scudo's weight loss and asked her, ""Are you ready for help?""</p>  <p>Scudo responded with an ""I got this, mom, I got it.""</p>  <p>I went from heroin addict to PTA mom</p>  <p>What the mirror told her</p>  <p>The breaking point came one morning after taking a shower.</p>  <p>Scudo looked at herself in a full-length mirror, naked, for the first time in six months.</p>  <p>""I looked like an Auschwitz survivor,"" she said. ""I was a skeleton. I had this lovely green glow going, so I knew my liver was shutting down. The skin was hanging, literally hanging off my body.</p>  <p>""And something about that moment when I saw myself triggered something in my head,"" she said.</p>  <p>The next day, her ex-husband called her at work in a confrontation about a problem. Scudo had enough. She wanted to drive her car off the highest overhang on Interstate 70, but feared she wouldn't die immediately and would end up in pain. She went home, kissed the two children still living with her, went to the bedroom and cried. She closed the door. She found eight OxyContin pills, but that wasn't going to be enough to kill her. She was used to downing six at a time, crushed.</p>  <p>She fell asleep and took a sick day from work the next morning.</p>  <p>How heroin kills you</p>  <p>Hitting bottom</p>  <p>Her mother knocked on her door at 10 a.m. Her son-in-law, who worked at the same company as Scudo, told her that Scudo took a sick day.</p>  <p>""Have you damn well had enough?"" her mother asked her.</p>  <p>""And for some reason, 'yes' came out of my mouth,"" Scudo said.</p>  <p>They checked her into a 30-day inpatient program for addiction on April 19, 2011, the last day she took drugs.</p>  <p>That meant her first day without dope was, ironically, also the unofficial, international get-high day of April 20, she noted.</p>  <p>Her detoxification was ""six days of hell,"" she said.</p>  <p>""I lost 9 pounds in six days,"" she recounted. ""I threw up every 15 minutes. I would have to live in the shower with the water temperature of 120 degrees to burn the skin to not feel the pain in my back.""</p>  <p>She's been clean for three years now, she said.</p>  <p>She's on her third marriage.</p>  <p>She's changed jobs, becoming an office manager over 200 employees at a credit card company.</p>  <p>And she no longer wants to die.</p>  <p>""I am not ashamed of the fact that I am who I am. The only way that I will not make this is if I start keeping secrets from myself and other people and then my head gets to start playing games with me and telling me it has a good idea,"" Scudo said. ""And I have got way too much to live for to go back.""</p>  <p>She now hosts a monthly family dinner -- for 45 people in her little green house.</p>  <p>And the grandchildren visit again the once-lost matriarch.</p>  <p>New abuse-deterrent painkiller approved</p>  <p>FDA aims to tighten control of hydrocodone</p>  <p>FDA fights drug overdoses with new labels for prescription painkillers</p>  <p>DEA turns to texting to fight prescription drug abuse</p> "

A close look at the official arrest logs of the St. Louis County police, which CNN obtained Friday, shows that while some people did travel to Ferguson to protest the shooting of a black teen by a white police officer , a majority of the people arrested live in the St. Louis area.</p>  <p>More than half of them were charged with a relatively minor offense: refusing to disperse when asked by police.</p>  <p>Read the arrest log (PDF)</p>  <p>Ferguson is a small suburban town, just 21,000 people packed into six square miles flush against St. Louis International Airport. The unrest started when unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death August 9 by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. Anger over the shooting, and the Ferguson police department's initial refusal to identify the officer who shot Brown, set off nightly confrontations between police and protesters.</p>  <p>The worst violence came nine days after the shooting: on Monday into the wee hours of Tuesday. Police responded in militarized fashion, firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd and confiscating firearms, Molotov cocktails and, reportedly, water bottles filled with urine. There was sporadic looting.</p>  <p>Where is Officer Darren Wilson?</p>  <p>The force of the police response has been sharply criticized. But the finger-pointing went both ways. Some officials in Ferguson blamed outsiders for stirring up trouble.</p>  <p>A deeper dive into the arrest logs and a search of social media and online news accounts show some self-avowed ""communists"" and others who could be considered ""agitators."" But the vast majority of arrestees who gave out-of-town addresses were college students, peaceniks, legal advisers and journalists.</p>  <p>The logs compiled by the St. Louis County police cover August 10 through 22 and list 212 arrests in Ferguson. They can't tell the full story, since they do not include arrests made by Ferguson police. They do not identify the arrestees by age or race. No incident reports are attached to provide details.</p>  <p>Ferguson residents say police have a 'power trip problem'</p>  <p>But the numbers do tell this simple story: 130 people were charged with refusal to disperse, 18 or so with burglary -- which may or may not be related to looting -- and nine with disorderly conduct. A handful of people were charged with resisting arrest and two people were charged with careless driving.</p>  <p>And, 20 people appear to have made a serious tactical error by joining the crowd in Ferguson: They were picked up on existing arrest or fugitive warrants.</p>  <p>Seven of the people arrested were journalists trying to cover the story . The list does not include reporters from the Washington Post and Huffington Post, who were arrested in the early days of the protests. It does include a Getty photographer who was arrested, along with several international journalists and representatives from online media sites. An eighth was a college senior, a journalism major photographing the protests for a newspaper in Cincinnati.</p>  <p>Thursday night saw an eerie quiet descend, and the number of arrests dropped sharply; only eight were reported.</p>  <p>Out of the glare, under the noise, other voices tell of a town called Ferguson</p>  <p>What we know about Ferguson</p> "

""I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know.

""The Earth is a rock and everything else on it is ATWA.""</p>  <p>Why people still pay attention to Manson</p>  <p>After a few years of sending letters and talking to Manson on the phone, Star, at age 19, moved to Corcoran, a small central California city that's home to Corcoran State Prison, where Charles Manson has lived for the past 25 years.</p>  <p>She talks to Manson almost every day by phone and visits him on most weekends.</p>  <p>""We talk about anything and everything, you know, like what's going' on today-- who's doing what.

"113","Abortion law ruling a win for women","CNN.com","2014-08-05 00:37:10","2014-10-06 05:12:00","http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/04/opinion/jennings-alabama-abortion/index.html","Justice"," <p>As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine.</p>  <p>Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws (a number of states have adopted them) do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety.</p>  <p>That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them.</p>  <p>Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications.</p>  <p>For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare.</p>  <p>Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis.</p>  <p>It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period.</p>  <p>In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations.</p>  <p>Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals.</p>  <p>As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin.</p>  <p>These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible.</p>  <p>Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine .</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

I have something to say to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>  <p>Dear Roger,</p>  <p>We thought you really cared. We believed you when you said you wanted to create a more welcoming NFL game for women.</p>  <p>And all of us were touched by the compassion you showed with your Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, even though those hot pink cleats disturbingly clashed with every NFL uniform. Mr. Commissioner, you even talked endlessly about making NFL stadiums around the nation more family-friendly.</p>  <p>And despite all the disturbing medical reports of NFL players with life-threatening concussions, you have worked tirelessly to try to convince us moms that the game remains safe for our precious sons. (I forgave you for stretching the truth past all the medical evidence on that one.) And still, we thought: Now that man really cares. What a guy.</p>  <p>We repaid your good deeds by watching the games in record numbers, helping the league boost its television ratings. We even started turning up at stadiums around the nation and buying all those form-fitting team-branded outfits now made for women.</p>  <p>The NFL reported earnings of more than $9 billion last year , thanks in large part to women, who make up nearly 45% of the league's fan base.</p>  <p>So, knowing you as we do, there was no doubt that you'd send down the harshest penalty possible for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after he was caught on camera dragging his then-fiancee, Janay, like a rag doll out of the elevator.</p>  <p>Surely, you, like all the rest of us, must have been appalled by Rice's actions. Roger will handle it, we thought. No way the commissioner who prides himself on being tough on players who step out of line will let this atrocious behavior go unpunished.</p>  <p>What fools we have been. A two-game suspension? You repay our loyalty with an insult? And you expect us to accept that -- to keep on supporting your game? Not happening here. You've shown us your true face. And sadly, you, Mr. Commissioner are a fake, a fraud, a liar. Turns out you never really cared about women at all.</p>  <p>Where is the indignation and outrage you showed the world when handing down the indefinite suspension for NFL quarterback Michael Vick in 2007 after he admitted his role in a dogfighting ring?</p>  <p>""Your admitted conduct is not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. ... Your team, fans and the NFL have all been hurt by your actions,"" you wrote to Vick in a formal letter from the league. ""Your career, freedom and your public standing are now in the most serious jeopardy. I hope that you will be able to learn from this difficult experience and emerge from it better prepared to act responsibly and to make the kinds of choices that are expected of a conscientious and law-abiding citizen.""</p>  <p>By your lights, it sounds like dogs are more important than women. Or perhaps you subscribe to the philosophy of my misguided colleague, sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who raised the issue of whether Rice's wife somehow brought an ""element of provocation"" into the situation.</p>  <p>Rightfully, Smith was suspended for a week by ESPN. But at least he has faced his critics. You, Mr. Goodell, were hiding out in your NFL ivory tower until you were forced to face the league's female fans and try to defend the indefensible.</p>  <p>It's good to know where we stand with you now, Roger. We should have known that you were just stringing us along. Saying all the right words. Sadly, we love this game so much it was easy to look the other way. Easy to believe.</p>  <p>But you've gone too far. It's time for us to fight back. I'm declaring week three, Sunday, September 21, 1:00 p.m. an NFL blackout day in my house. That's the game when Rice is scheduled to return to the field after serving his paltry suspension. And I'm urging every woman I know to do the same. The blackout continues until we hear your apology.</p>  <p>You don't take 45% of your customers for granted. Because, in case you didn't know, Roger, without women watching the NFL, you lose.</p>  <p>And we are keeping score.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "
"115","Blow to Obamacare won't stick","CNN.com","2014-07-31 15:50:45","2014-10-06 05:12:36","http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/23/opinion/gorod-obamacare-ruling/index.html","Justice"," <p>Fortunately, it won't be the last word on the matter. And the decision issued later Tuesday by another federal appellate court -- the 4th Circuit -- in King v. Burwell makes clear why: The D.C. Circuit's decision got basically everything wrong. It misunderstood the text, structure and purpose of the Affordable Care Act. The Justice Department has already indicated that it will ask the entire D.C. Circuit to review the Halbig v. Burwell decision, and when it does, it will no doubt reverse it.</p>  <p>These two cases are both part of what Judge Harry Edwards, the dissenting judge in Halbig, termed a ""not-so-veiled attempt to gut"" the Affordable Care Act. As the members of Congress who led the enactment of the law made clear in a ""friend of the court"" brief they submitted to both courts this year, the fundamental purpose of the statute was to achieve universal health care coverage, and the Internal Revenue Service providing tax credits that act as subsidies so low- and middle-income Americans can pay for health care is central to doing so.</p>  <p>The plaintiffs in these challenges argue that these tax credits should not be available to people who buy insurance in the 36 states with exchanges operated by the federal government -- that is, who got their subsidized health coverage through HealthCare.gov , not a state-run exchange. It's a position that's not only completely without legal merit -- ""tortured"" and ""nonsensical,"" according to one of the 4th Circuit judges -- it's also one that would critically undermine how Obamacare works.</p>  <p>What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you</p>  <p>But rather than looking at the law as a whole and considering what it was attempting to accomplish, the D.C. Circuit judges focused on one small provision of what is a long and complicated statute. Edwards called the plaintiffs' argument ""illogical when cast in the context of the statute as a whole.""</p>  <p>Indeed, the plaintiffs themselves appeared to recognize how flawed their argument, based on the statute's language, was and thus manufactured an explanation for why Congress would have written the statute to eliminate the tax credits on federally facilitated exchanges. According to the plaintiffs, Congress wanted to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges. The only problem, as Edwards noted, is that the ""claim is nonsense, made up out of whole cloth."" The legal reasoning in the majority's opinion is so weak it is difficult to understand it as anything but a political decision.</p>  <p>And that is what makes particularly galling the judges' professed ""reluctance"" to reach their conclusion. These judges assert that their hands were tied by the ""limited"" role of judges in our democratic system. In other words, they imply, their decision -- which could have massive consequences for millions of Americans -- was actually an exercise of judicial restraint.</p>  <p>Appeals courts differ on Obamacare</p>  <p>There's nothing restrained about misreading a law's text, disregarding its structure and ignoring its purpose. In fact, it was the 4th Circuit judges who exercised true judicial restraint. Two of those judges concluded that the statute was unclear and that they should therefore defer to the agencies charged with implementing the law -- in this case, the IRS, which would provide the tax credit subsidies. (The other judge concluded that the statute is unambiguous, but in the other direction, and requires that tax credits be available on federally facilitated exchanges.)</p>  <p>As those judges recognized, where a law is unclear, the proper role of a judge is generally to defer to a reasonable construction offered by the executive branch agencies charged with implementing the statute.</p>  <p>The judges in Halbig seemed so determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act that they ignored this bedrock legal principle.

Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators. He entered the NFL draft after his junior year and was selected by the Patriots in the fourth round.</p>  <p>By the end of the second season, he inked a five-year contract extension worth $40 million. But less than a year later, he was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Odin Lloyd. Two hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team.</p>  <p>Hernandez has also been charged in the slayings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, and some of his closest associates are facing serious charges in connection with the alleged crimes.</p>  <p>Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and is expected to go on trial next year. Here is a primer on some of the names you might be hearing about ahead of his trials:</p>  <p>Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez</p>  <p>Odin Lloyd</p>  <p>Odin Lloyd was a 27-year-old semi-pro football player. He was found dead on June 17, 2013, less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He had been shot seven times. Lloyd met Hernandez while dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating Lloyd's execution.</p>  <p>Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado</p>  <p>Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed outside a Boston nightclub on July 16, 2012. Prosecutors say de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, spilling a drink. Later that night, Hernandez was driving an SUV and allegedly pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a .38-caliber revolver at them.</p>  <p>Alexander Bradley</p>  <p>Alexander Bradley is a former friend of Hernandez who was allegedly with Hernandez on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. He is not facing any charges in that case, but he is jailed on unrelated charges. He is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in February 2013. Bradley claims Hernandez accused him of ""disrespecting him"" over a cell phone left in a Miami strip club.</p>  <p>Carlos Ortiz</p>  <p>Carlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death Odin Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty. A law enforcement source said he cooperated with police and described the night of Lloyd's death.</p>  <p>Ernest Wallace</p>  <p>Ernest Wallace, nicknamed Hobo, is also charged with murder in the death of Odin Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors call him the ""muscle man"" for Hernandez. They say he was in the car with Hernandez, Lloyd and Carlos Ortiz an hour before the car is seen on video heading to the industrial park where Lloyd was killed.</p>  <p>Shayanna Jenkins</p>  <p>Shayanna Jenkins is Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his daughter. She is charged with perjury , allegedly lying to a grand jury about guns in their home. She has pleaded not guilty. Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Odin Lloyd at the time of his death.</p>  <p>Shaneah Jenkins</p>  <p>Shaneah Jenkins is the girlfriend of Odin Lloyd. Her sister is Hernandez's fiancée. In court, the two sisters sit on opposite sides, Shayanna with the defense and Shaneah with the prosecution.</p>  <p>Tanya Cummings-Singleton</p>  <p>Tanya Cummings-Singleton is a cousin of Hernandez. In her garage, police found the SUV allegedly driven by Hernandez and linked to the 2012 Boston double homicide. She was twice charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify before two grand juries despite immunity offers. She has pleaded guilty to obstruction in the Lloyd case. She is also suffering from cancer.</p>  <p>Thaddeus Singleton</p>  <p>Thaddeus Singleton, husband of Tanya Cummings-Singleton, was killed in a car accident after Lloyd's slaying. Police say his speeding car went airborne and crashed. A source says police planned to interview him about his relationship with Hernandez.</p>  <p>Shaquilla Thibou</p>  <p>Shaquilla Thibou is the sister of Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors say she saw her brother get into a car with Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz before he was killed. Prosecutors say she received a text from her brother that night telling her he was with ""Nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know.""</p>  <p>Terri Hernandez</p>  <p>Terri Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's mother. She is a school secretary.</p>  <p>Dennis Hernandez</p>  <p>Dennis Hernandez was Aaron Hernandez's father. He had a close relationship with his sons and was deeply involved in their sports training. He died unexpectedly after hernia surgery when Hernandez was 16.</p>  <p>DJ Hernandez</p>  <p>DJ Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's older brother. He was a star high school athlete. He also was a standout athlete at the University of Connecticut and now is an assistant coach at the University of Iowa.</p>  <p>Andrew Booker</p>  <p>Andrew Booker shared a jail unit with Aaron Hernandez. The two allegedly got into a jail fight , and Hernandez was indicted in Booker's assault.</p>  <p>The prosecution</p>  <p>District Attorney Samuel Sutter is leading the prosecution against Hernandez, along with William McCauley and Patrick Bomberg. ""Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,"" Sutter told CNN.</p>  <p>The defense</p>  <p>Attorneys James Sultan, Michael Fee and Charles Rankin are handling Hernandez's defense. Rankin says ""not one shred of evidence has been presented yet."" He said he is confident Hernandez will be exonerated.</p> "

She said that Utah ""was drowning in prescription pill addiction."" Shannon divulged that she had actually been abusing heroin for some time, but -- as with most people with addiction problems in Utah -- it all started with pills.</p>  <p>Out of all 50 states, Utah ranks eighth in the number of prescription drugs overdose deaths, according to Susannah Burt with the state's Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health . And, despite a dip in 2008, the number of pill-related deaths in Utah over the past decade has increased by 400%, according to Burt.</p>  <p>I have always thought Utah had low levels of addiction because of the influence of its large Mormon population -- more than 60% of those living there are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I've even known Mormons there who don't drink coffee in deference to their religion's ""Word of Wisdom,"" a health law that strongly discourages people from consuming things that are harmful to their bodies.</p>  <p>You'd have to be hiding under a rock to not know how highly addictive prescription pills can be . And people in Utah, who have statistically speaking been successful at maintaining healthier lives , are no less vulnerable. In fact, because medications are prescribed by a physician, the assumption often is that they're OK.</p>  <p>Many people who've been able to maintain diligence in upholding the LDS Word of Wisdom have fallen victim to pill addiction because of the gray area that doctor-prescribed pills inhabit.</p>  <p>While the Mormon church hierarchy certainly isn't proud of the exploding numbers, it didn't hide from the issue, giving us access to talk to those dealing with the struggles of addiction.</p>  <p>Earlier this year, we spent 12 days in Utah with church leaders and people in recovery as well as people deep in the throes of addiction. I met people who wore their hearts on their sleeves who shared some of their most painful moments.</p>  <p>They allowed me into their worlds because they acknowledge pill addiction is a huge problem within their community and they know they need help.</p>  <p>The people I spent time with are incredibly brave -- particularly Shannon who I'm happy to report has been clean for quite awhile now.

Perhaps three dozen more are expected to be added in coming months. The caseload for the term is usually settled by February, with the term effectively ending in late June.</p>  <p>Other important appeals that may yet be added cover such issues as same-sex marriage, affirmative action, abortion rights and further litigation over President Obama's health care reform law.</p>  <p>Cases already on the Supreme Court docket:</p>  <p>FREE SPEECH: Elonis v. United States</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: The limits of policing ""speech crimes"" in the Internet age, especially laws aimed at protecting those harassed or bullied online. What is the level of proof needed to convict someone of making criminal threats?</p>  <p>THE CASE: Anthony Elonis was convicted in federal court for threatening language in Facebook posts aimed at his estranged wife, judges and law enforcement. Some were expressed as rap lyrics, which Elonis said were ""therapeutic"" for dealing with emotional pain. But prosecutors said he crossed a dangerous free speech line.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: Elonis' lawyers argue that the government did not prove that his statements showed a ""subjective intent to threaten,"" based on Supreme Court precedent. But the Justice Department replied that his online comments were serious in nature, not a case of ""careless talk, exaggeration, something said in a joking manner or an outburst of transitory anger.""</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: A ruling here could have broader implications for free speech amid the explosion of popular and often anonymous social media. Are sites like Twitter in the same category as more conventional news links, and are general threats made online different from those made in person?</p>  <p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM: Holt v. Hobbs</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: An inmate wants to grow a ½-inch beard in accordance with his beliefs, citing rights under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, is a Muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the court. Arkansas prison policy allows only a ""neatly trimmed mustache.""</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: Corrections officials say beards can hide contraband and make it hard to identify prisoners, so such security concerns deserve deference from courts. But Holt's lawyers -- backed by the Obama administration -- say that a less restrictive policy should be adopted.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: Holt has the support of both civil liberties and religious freedom groups, who have often been traditional foes. Last term, the justices ruled that some for-profit companies whose owners expressed strong Christian beliefs had a First Amendment right to oppose Obamacare health mandates providing contraception coverage for their workers.</p>  <p>EXECUTIVE POWER: Zivotofsky v. Kerry</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: The constitutionality of a federal statute that explicitly directs the secretary of state how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a Consular Report of Birth Abroad and on a passport. Does the law impermissibly infringe on the President's power to recognize a foreign nation?</p>  <p>THE CASE: Thirteen-year-old Menachem Zivotofsky is a U.S. citizen, and his parents want his birthplace listed as ""Jerusalem, Israel,"" but U.S. diplomatic officials said they could use only ""Jerusalem."" The status of the holy city remains in dispute, and U.S. policy is reflected in the fact that it does not currently recognize any country as having sovereignty over the region.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: The justices three years ago allowed the lawsuit by the family to proceed. It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the holy city, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital: The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: This dispute may be fact-specific, but the federal government is thinking of the bigger political and diplomatic picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record in a pending case, but President Barack Obama has acknowledged that the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the United States.</p>  <p>WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION : Young v. United Parcel Service</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: The duty of employers to provide workplace accommodations under the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Expectant mother Peggy Young's request for a ""light duty"" assignment from her regular work as a truck driver was denied, even though the company allegedly had done so for other workers temporarily unable to perform their functions. Young, who worked in suburban Washington, then had to take unpaid leave, with a subsequent loss of medical benefits.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: The company and Young focus on two different readings of the act and whether UPS' ""pregnancy-blind"" policy on the ability to work protects it from liability.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: The ruling could add significantly to the evolving canon of judicial oversight over job discrimination claims.</p>  <p>Cases that may be added to the Supreme Court docket in coming months:</p>  <p>SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: Various pending appeals from state officials in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: Whether state bans on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantees.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Thirty-one states do not allow same-sex marriage. Legal, political and social momentum favoring the right has accelerated in the past year after the Supreme Court in a peripheral case struck down part of a congressional law that recognized marriage for federal purposes as between only one man and one woman.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: Gay rights groups say the bans are discriminatory and single out homosexuals for disparate treatment. But many states say that the voters -- not the courts -- should decide such matters and that traditional marriage encourages opposite-sex couples to raise children in a stable family unit.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: A final ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court would be a landmark on many social levels. The justices could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or they could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures to sort it all out, for now.</p>  <p>ABORTION RIGHTS: Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: A challenge to a Texas law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a clinic where they are providing abortion services.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Other states have adopted similar laws, and lower courts have issued conflicting rulings.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: Abortion-rights supporters say the provision is unconstitutionally restrictive and has forced more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas to close. State officials, including Gov. Rick Perry, have said the law ensures that clinics are no operating under ""dangerous conditions.""</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: Another part of the Texas law is also being reviewed by a federal appeals court: the requirement that abortions be provided in only walk-in hospital-type surgical centers, which could force closure of many smaller women's health clinics. 11 other states have similar restrictions. If the case is accepted for review, the justices will again tackle one of the most contentious social issues.</p>  <p>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: Fisher v. University of Texas</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: A renewed challenge to the school's race-conscious admissions policies.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she a high senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Fisher claims that she was turned away because she is white. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors -- such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: The high court first heard this case two years ago, issuing a ruling with no clear winner. The justices affirmed the limited use of race in the admissions process but made it somewhat harder for institutions to apply such policies to achieve diversity. The case went back to a federal appeals court for further scrutiny, which decided in the school's favor in July.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: The Fisher dispute will now probably be reviewed once again by the Supreme Court in coming months, with the potential for a definitive 21st-century ruling. The issue of race and education offers vexing questions of competition, fairness and demographics -- and what role government should play when promoting political and social diversity.</p> "

The mother will face charges in Travis County, Texas, said Dan Powers, an FBI assistant special agent in charge in San Antonio, Texas.</p>  <p>So much time has passed that Allen's daughter is all but grown, now 17 years old. Moreover, his daughter has been told over the years that her father was ""a bad guy"" and ""a wife beater"" -- all false accusations, Allen declared.</p>  <p>But Allen never gave up hope.</p>  <p>He began a website dedicated to his daughter: FindSabrina.org , which offered a $20,000 reward. He hired a private investigator. And he pressed his public campaign so relentlessly that people wondered whether he was going too far.</p>  <p>""I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,"" Allen said of his pursuit. ""I've had people say, ""Of course, she's with her mother; what's the big deal?'</p>  <p>""People just don't understand,"" he said. ""I was accused of overstepping my bounds.""</p>  <p>A confidential informant</p>  <p>On Wednesday, Allen was euphoric over his daughter's recovery. He learned the news while at the dentist Tuesday and had to rinse his mouth. The police action resulted in a minor injury to a federal Mexican police officer who was involved in the arrest of Llorens, 44, according to Philip Klein, a private investigator retained by Allen.</p>  <p>Llorens was located in Mexico through information from a confidential informant, Klein said.</p>  <p>But Sabrina Allen has been through so much emotional trauma that she isn't allowed to immediately see her father. She's in solid physical health but hasn't been in school for a while, her father said. She is now under the care of a clinical psychologist in Texas.</p>  <p>""I haven't gotten to see her yet,"" Greg Allen said Wednesday.</p>  <p>""She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,"" he said, becoming tearful. ""She's just not ready to see me and my family. I hope and pray that's coming soon, and I can't predict it.""</p>  <p>He described the 12-year hunt for his daughter as a tormenting odyssey.</p>  <p>""It's a long road.

""I told myself the hardest thing to learn was that I could have a life while looking for her.""</p>  <p>When Sabrina Allen is eventually allowed to reunite with her father, she will discover that she has a new family who has heard so much about her but has never met her: Greg Allen's new wife and their children.</p>  <p>""We hope to have her home as soon as possible,"" Allen said.</p>  <p>How his daughter was taken from him began on April 19, 2002, according to the website dedicated to his once-missing daughter.</p>  <p>A weekend outing</p>  <p>On that day, Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with her daughter during a scheduled weekend visit, the FBI said in its wanted bulletin for Llorens.</p>  <p>Llorens was supposed to return the daughter to her father two days later. He was the primary guardian, the FBI said.</p>  <p>The father's website doesn't specify why the relationship between him and Llorens didn't work out, but the site alleges that Llorens has a mental illness.</p>  <p>""Dara's court ordered psychological evaluation indicated that she has a well-established personality disorder, and that she is likely to act in her own interest, instead of Sabrina's,"" the website charges.</p>  <p>Llorens and her attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.</p>  <p>On the day Llorens was scheduled to return Sabrina, the mother failed to appear at the pickup site, the FBI said.</p>  <p>Llorens had moved from her residence in north Austin and left a false forwarding address, the father's website said. Llorens didn't even contact work when she disappeared with Sabrina Allen, the webpage said.</p>  <p>Warrants and wanted posters</p>  <p>Later that month, a Texas warrant was issued for Llorens, accusing her of interference with child custody, and then a federal warrant was issued in May 2002, charging Llorens with unlawful flight, authorities said.</p>  <p>Llorens even became wanted by the FBI, which published a public bulletin describing her as someone who ""may walk with a mild limp"" and ""may have travelled to Mexico, where she has ties."" On his website, Greg Allen described her as a thin, petite woman who ""typically does not keep a job for more than six months"" and ""may be likely to take a retail sales job.""</p>  <p>Sabrina Allen was listed on the FBI poster as every bit a little girl: 3-foot-6 and 35 pounds, with pierced ears, a mole on her right knee and a small scar on the bridge of her nose.</p>  <p>See a copy of the FBI wanted poster (PDF)</p>  <p>Her father described her as a cheerful child who liked ""Barbies, bugs, dress-up, movies, Snow White and Scooby-Doo.""</p>  <p>""Sabrina has many friends and a large, loving family in Austin. She is very dearly missed,"" the father's website says.</p>  <p>The case briefly came to the attention of CNN in November 2002, when host John Walsh of ""America's Most Wanted"" appeared on the network.</p>  <p>When Walsh was told that Sabrina Allen had been missing seven months, he said, ""We have a chance of getting her back. She was taken by her ... mother, and that little girl we may be able to get back. But it's by pictures ... that's how we get missing children back, by exposure like this.""</p>  <p>Meanwhile, her father pressed authorities and media outlets about his missing daughter. He even posted photo galleries of him and his daughter on the website.</p>  <p>""This is my school picture. My Daddy says, 'What a big girl,' "" one photo caption says.</p>  <p>""It's my fourth birthday. Who says I'm not a princess?"" another says.</p>  <p>Trying to hide in Mexico</p>  <p>While his daughter and her mother lived in Mexico, the girl went by ""Blanquita,"" the diminutive of Blanca, one of the several aliases that Llorens was using, according to the father's website said. The FBI also alleged that Llorens used many aliases.</p>  <p>Despite the use of Spanish names, the father asserted that his daughter and her mother would not have blended in Mexican society: Lloren's Spanish was ""poor,"" and their daughter ""does not look at all Hispanic,"" the father said on his website.</p>  <p>In fact, Sabrina Allen's middle name is Fair.</p>  <p>""It is unlikely that they could hide in a Hispanic community without standing out,"" Allen said on his website.</p>  <p>But Sabrina Allen was repeatedly disguised, right down to her eyebrows and eyelashes, which were dyed, as was her hair, the website said.</p>  <p>Sabrina's natural blonde hair was colored red and other hues on varying occasions, the father's website said.</p>  <p>As friendly and outgoing as the little girl was, the act of being spirited away imposed an emotional toll on her, the website charges.</p>  <p>""It is reported that she is sometime(s) distant and burdened with the secrets she is being made to keep,"" the website said. ""It is reported that Sabrina has lost weight and is suffering physically and psychologically.""</p>  <p>At one point, Llorens apparently enrolled her daughter in the preschool Tegui in Colonia del Valle in Mexico City, and Sabrina reportedly learned how to speak Spanish ""very well"" and to read and write the language, the father's website said.</p>  <p>A promising moment came for Greg Allen when Sabrina Allen and her mother were spotted in Mexico City, on June 13, 2003.</p>  <p>But they eluded authorities.</p>  <p>It would take 11 more years before authorities finally caught up to Sabrina Allen and her mother.</p>  <p>What now remains to be seen is how much of her father Sabrina Allen remembers -- and how much of his great hunt for her she'll come to fathom.</p> "

Later he explained to HLN's Nancy Grace that included text messages, but he declined to elaborate on the nature of the texts.</p>  <p>Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris.</p>  <p>""I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,"" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post.

Jury selection began Monday morning. The retrial will follow and is expected to last about two weeks.</p>  <p>Before jury selection began, Davis' parents, Ron Davis and Lucia McBath, were outside the Duval County Courthouse, along with Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teen killed by a neighborhood watch captain earlier the same year.</p>  <p>""This trial speaks to me because I am that family,"" Fulton said. ""The family that's missing a son. I'm the family that's a victim of senseless gun violence. That's the purpose of me coming here, that's just to stand with the family, to be with the family and to show the support.""</p>  <p>About 40 people gathered demanding justice for Jordan Davis as well as other slain African-Americans, including Emmett Till, Rodney Mitchell and Karvas Gamble Jr. Protesters carried signs that said ""Justice 4 Jordan"" and ""Is it OK to murder me because I like loud music?""</p>  <p>A pastor led the group in prayer before Davis' parents entered the courthouse. The gathering promptly dispersed, but not before McBath thanked the crowd for supporting her son.</p>  <p>""We just want to thank the country and thank you all for the wonderful support and prayers that you've given us these last two years. We could not do this without you. We're very grateful for every moment that we've been on your minds and your hearts,"" McBath said.</p>  <p>She added, ""Whatever verdict we receive, we will be humble and abide by. But the verdict and the justice that we seek will always and will only come from God.""</p>  <p>Defense attorney Waffa Hanania expressed concern to County Court Judge Russell Healey that the rally, which ""appears to be sanctioned by Mr. Davis' family,"" could influence potential jurors.</p>  <p>Healey responded that there is ""only so much I can control,"" but conceded that ""it's not helpful to us getting a jury here in Jacksonville."" He said that the court would determine what potential jurors heard and saw when they're questioned.</p>  <p>The first tria l</p>  <p>Earlier this year, on what would've been Davis' 19th birthday, a Jacksonville, Florida, jury found Dunn guilty on four of five counts in the case.</p>  <p>While Dunn said he shot into a Dodge Durango full of teenagers in self-defense, he was convicted on three counts of second-degree attempted murder -- one each for firing at Davis' pals, Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes and Tevin Thompson -- and one count of shooting into a vehicle.</p>  <p>The attempted murder convictions alone carry a cumulative minimum sentence of 60 years in prison for the 47-year-old Florida man.</p>  <p>Opinion: Why prosecutor is retrying 'loud music' murder case</p>  <p>The 12 jurors, however, deadlocked on the final and most serious charge: premeditated first-degree murder.</p>  <p>Dunn claimed that after a heated argument over loud music at a Jacksonville gas station, Davis threatened him and Dunn thought he saw Davis produce a gun or lead pipe.</p>  <p>Though Davis had a knife in his pocket, police recovered no weapons matching Dunn's description, and his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, testified that Dunn never mentioned seeing a weapon.</p>  <p>Following the argument, Dunn pulled out a handgun and began firing. He continued firing even as Stornes, the driver, put the Durango in reverse and retreated, witnesses said.</p>  <p>Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV. Three of those bullets hit Davis, one piercing his liver, lung and aorta.</p>  <p>'... they didn't call 911'</p>  <p>After the shooting, neither Dunn nor Rouer called police. They drove 40 miles to a bed and breakfast in St. Augustine, and once there, defense attorney Cory Strolla said, Dunn took his dog for a walk and Rouer ordered a pizza and movie.</p>  <p>""They had cell phones, but they didn't call 911. He didn't drive to a police substation,"" Assistant State Attorney John Guy said during the first trial. ""That defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep.""</p>  <p>Asked why he never called police, Dunn said, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why.""</p>  <p>In the morning, Rouer watched a news report about the shooting and the two then drove another 130 miles home to Satellite Beach where Dunn was apprehended.</p>  <p>What happened in the hours after the shooting may play a role in the new murder trial, as prosecutors must prove that Dunn planned to kill Davis. In the first trial, prosecutors alleged that Dunn's actions after the shooting were indicative of his intent, an assertion Dunn's defense attorney denied.</p>  <p>Davis' father, Ron Davis, was certainly struck by Dunn's actions after killing his son and expressed satisfaction in February that Dunn would face a lengthy prison bid.</p>  <p>""He is going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son, that it was not just another day at the office. My son will never be just another day at the office where (Dunn) can leave the scene and be stoic,"" he told reporters.</p>  <p>Awaiting sentencing</p>  <p>Dunn has not yet been sentenced on the original counts. In addition to the 60-year minimum he faces on the attempted murder charges, he could spend another 15 years in prison on the count of shooting into a vehicle.</p>  <p>While his new defense attorney, Hanania, hasn't been speaking to media, Strolla has said his client would appeal the original verdict.</p>  <p>That may explain why -- even though, pending appeals, Dunn could spend the rest of his life in prison -- prosecutors are preparing for another highly publicized trial on the murder charge.</p>  <p>To hear prosecutor Angela Corey tell it, it's about justice.</p>  <p>""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" she said after the first trial in February.</p>  <p>CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said he can see how some people might think it defies logic to try the case again, but from Davis' parents' perspective, it makes all the sense in the world.</p>  <p>""If he winds up with 60 or 75 years in jail, from a pragmatic standpoint it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to retry the case,"" Callan said after the first trial.</p>  <p>""On the other hand if you're the parents of Jordan Davis and you believe, as well you should, that your son's reputation has been besmirched by this self-defense claim, the family (might) want a retrial, and that's something that a prosecutor has to consider carefully.""</p> "

A third defendant, former plant quality control manager Mary Wilkerson, was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice.</p>  <p>The Parnell brothers, Moore said, ""could easily spend the rest of their lives in prison.""</p>  <p>Both men were taken into custody pending sentencing. Bond was set at $150,000 for Stewart Parnell and $100,000 for his brother, Moore said. A sentencing date has not been set.</p>  <p>Stewart Parnell's lawyer, Thomas Bondurant, said he will appeal the verdict.</p>  <p>""We think it was the wrong decision and we will continue to fight on behalf of Stewart Parnell,"" he said.</p>  <p>Jeff Almer, whose mother, Shirley Almer, died after she ate peanut butter that came from Parnell's processing plant, Peanut Corp. of America, said he felt relief as the clerk began to read the verdict. He had prepared to hear the worst -- that the Parnells would be acquitted. Instead, he heard the word ""guilty"" over and over again.</p>  <p>""It was validation,"" said Almer, who traveled from Minnesota to Georgia for the trial. ""It was emotional.""</p>  <p>After about the 14th ""guilty,"" the words began to fade and Almer thought of his mother, who died four days before Christmas in 2008.</p>  <p>""I don't think these people are devils,"" he said, ""but they let greed take over their morals.""</p>  <p>Food safety lawyers also applauded the jury's decision.</p>  <p>""If anybody deserved it, he did,"" Minnesota-based trial lawyer Fred Pritzker said of Stewart Parnell.</p>  <p>""I am not at all surprised he was found guilty given the evidence against him,"" said Pritzker, who represented some of the victims of the outbreak.</p>  <p>Federal prosecutors presented more than 1,000 documents and called 45 witnesses to the stand to make their case that Parnell, his brother and Wilkerson cut corners on safety in order to make a bigger profit for Peanut Corp. They were accused of covering up lab results that tested positive for salmonella in their peanut products.</p>  <p>The prosecution's blistering opening statement contained three now-infamous words Stewart Parnell penned in a March 2007 email to a plant manager about tainted products: ""Just ship it.""</p>  <p>Defense statements and witnesses, which took all of 104 minutes, portrayed Parnell as a small business owner who was scapegoated by the government.</p>  <p>At one point, the jury was shown a photograph of peanut butter made at Peanut Corp. sitting on Parnell's dining table at home. Defense attorneys said Parnell would not have had the peanut butter in his own home had he known it to be compromised.</p>  <p>The trial opened August 1 in Albany, Georgia, less than an hour's drive from the Peanut Corp. plant in the small town of Blakely, raided and shuttered in 2009 by federal food inspectors.</p>  <p>The 2008-2009 salmonella outbreak killed nine people, sickened at least 714 others nationwide and resulted in a huge food recall that cast a pall over one of America's favorite foods: peanut butter.</p>  <p>Food safety advocates said the trial was groundbreaking because it's so rare corporate executives are held accountable in court for bacteria in food.</p>  <p>Never before had a jury heard a criminal case in which a corporate chief faced federal felony charges for knowingly shipping out food containing salmonella.</p>  <p>Pritzker praised public health officials whose sleuth work eventually traced the outbreak's origins back to the Peanut Corp. plant in Blakely.</p>  <p>""I don't view (Parnell's) conduct as any different than poisoning people or drunk driving,"" Pritzker said. ""My strong suspicion is that this happens much more often than is known.""</p>  <p>However, Parnell and his co-defendants were not on trial for poisoning people or causing any deaths stemming from the outbreak, and prosecutors did not mention the deaths to the jury.</p>  <p>Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who also represented several victims of the outbreak, said the government would have had the added burden of proving the deaths were linked to Parnell had they mentioned them. Those facts were not necessary, Marler said, to prove the charges at hand.</p>  <p>Marler said he hopes Friday's verdict will send a message to corporations that they cannot get away with this kind of behavior.</p>  <p>The prosecution was unprecedented, Marler said, because the Department of Justice charged the Parnell brothers with felonies. Prior cases involved misdemeanors.</p>  <p>""Prosecutors took a risk and fortunately, the jury believed them,"" Marler said. ""The jury saw this for what it was. The emails and documents told a story of a company that was more interested in shipping out products than products that were safe.""</p>  <p>Salmonella is America's most common cause of foodborne illness and sickens up to 1.4 million people every year.</p>  <p>Former employees of Peanut Corp. described filthy conditions at the Georgia plant. Federal inspectors found roaches, rats, mold, dirt, accumulated grease and bird droppings during their raid. They also found a leaky roof.</p>  <p>Salmonella is often associated with meat, poultry, eggs and raw milk -- products from animals that are carriers of the bacteria. It also thrives in the intestines of birds and can be found in fruits and vegetables and in ingredients made from them.</p>  <p>The presence of water in what is supposed to be a dry processing facility for peanuts is like adding gasoline to fire for salmonella, food safety experts say.</p>  <p>Health officials discovered similar poor conditions at Peanut Corp.'s other processing plant in Plainview, Texas. The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy shortly after it was shut down.</p>  <p>Two former plant managers worked out deals with the government in exchange for their testimonies against Parnell.</p>  <p>Follow CNN's Moni Basu on Twitter.</p> "

They said his motive was sex.</p>  <p>The theory was that ""Hennis' wife was out of town, he had a new baby and so he decided to make a pass at a married mother of three -- and that didn't go well,"" former local reporter Scott Whisnant told CNN's ""Death Row Stories."" Whisnant had covered the case in depth for Wilmington's Morning Star newspaper.</p>  <p>Gary Eastburn told police several items were missing from his home, including an envelope of cash, an ATM card and the Eastburn account password. Police said the ATM card was used to withdraw $150 twice over two days.</p>  <p>Prosecutors said Hennis was behind on his rent, which was about $300. He paid his rent the Monday after the killings, prosecutors said. A woman who used the same bank ATM shortly after the Eastburns' ATM card was used told investigators she saw a man nearby matching Hennis' description.</p>  <p>During the trial, prosecutors showed jurors gruesome police photos to illustrate their case. The jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced Hennis to death.</p>  <p>While on death row, Hennis received a mysterious, anonymous letter in the mail: ""Dear Mr. Hennis,"" the letter said. ""I did the crime, I murdered the Eastburns. Sorry you're doin the time. I'll be safely out of North Carolina when you read this. Thanks, Mr. X""</p>  <p>The letter's author was never determined.</p>  <p>A second chance to prove his case</p>  <p>Hennis' lawyers appealed his case to North Carolina's Supreme Court, where judges ruled that the graphic police photos had wrongly influenced jurors to render a guilty verdict. The ruling allowed Hennis a rare second chance to prove his case in a retrial.</p>  <p>Compared with the first trial, Hennis' defense attorneys engineered a complete 180 on their strategy. After exhaustive preparation, they attacked many of the prosecutors' most damaging accusations one by one. They discredited the prosecutors' star witness, Patrick Cone, and his testimony. He had testified that the weather was clear the night of the killings, but another witness said it was overcast.</p>  <p>A new defense witness who looked similar to Hennis testified he was walking in the neighborhood at the time of the killings.</p>  <p>The witness, John Raupaugh, ""lived down the street from the Eastburns,"" Whisnant told ""Death Row Stories."" ""He was an uneasy sleeper and had a habit of walking the neighborhood at 3 in the morning. He often wore a beanie hat and he had a black Members Only jacket."" Raupaugh's testimony, defense attorneys said, gave jurors the reasonable doubt they needed to acquit Hennis in 1989.</p>  <p>Escaping death row as a newly freed man, Hennis then re-enlisted in the Army, eventually retiring in 2004 as a master sergeant.</p>  <p>But prosecutors continued to pursue the case.</p>  <p>In 2006, vaginal swabs from a rape kit taken from Kathryn Eastburn's body yielded new evidence. DNA testing was an imperfect science in the 1980s, so the semen found in Kathryn Eastburn's vagina wasn't pursued as evidence during the first trial. But by the 2000s, technological advances in DNA analysis had improved. Experts said the DNA from Eastburn's rape kit was consistent with Hennis' DNA.</p>  <p>U.S. Army steps in</p>  <p>A team of military attorneys evaluated the case and the Army decided to pursue it. Hennis was recalled to active duty two years after his retirement and promptly arrested on three counts of murder.</p>  <p>""Tim Hennis is the only person in United States history who's been tried for his life three times after guilty and not guilty verdicts,"" said Whisnant, whose book ""Innocent Victims"" was made into a 1996 TV movie.</p>  <p>Many observers were surprised. Wasn't Hennis shielded by constitutional protections against so-called double jeopardy?</p>  <p>""In the simplest terms, if a defendant is acquitted and the prosecutor says to the judge, 'I want a do-over,' that is clearly prohibited. That's the definition of double jeopardy,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""But if a different prosecutor in a different court comes up with a different way to frame charges in the same crime, then that is generally permissible.""</p>  <p>Maj. Rob Stelle of the Army Judge Advocate General Corps, who worked on the Hennis case, told ""Death Row Stories"" that the military's ability to prosecute a case that has already been tried is ""well-settled law. Nothing the state does actually effects what the federal government can do.""</p>  <p>""In a very narrow category of cases where the federal government believes an injustice has been done, then federal prosecutors will step in,"" Toobin said. ""But by and large, they operate in separate spheres.""</p>  <p>When it came down to it, the prosecution's case in Hennis' court-martial hinged on the DNA testing results.</p>  <p>""The sperm found in the vagina of Mrs. Kathryn Eastburn is the person who raped and slaughtered her and her children. And that's Timothy Hennis,"" Maj. Matt Scott, another Army JAG attorney who worked on the case, told ""Death Row Stories.""</p>  <p>The jury rendered a guilty verdict and sentenced Hennis to death. He now sits in solitary confinement on death row at Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas, awaiting appeal.</p>  <p>But many unanswered questions remain. ""There's a ton of physical evidence in that house that they can't explain,"" Whisnant told CNN's ""Death Row Stories.""</p>  <p>A head hair was found in the Eastburns' bed that is not Hennis', Whisnant said. Unidentified DNA was found under Kathryn Eastburn's fingernails. ""We should be running that DNA against our known database,"" Whisnant said. ""Let's find out what happened.""</p>  <p>It likely will be a long time before the final page is written in this bizarre murder mystery.</p>  <p>Even after the appeals process is over, Hennis cannot be executed without presidential approval. In recent years, that hasn't happened very often. The U.S. military has not executed anyone from its ranks since 1961.</p> "

She meandered the city's streets that night, bouncing between groups of friends before being spotted by Ricky House Jr., a man who was familiar to her, according to Chief Deputy Tom Latham of the Posey County Sheriff's Office. House offered her a ride. She accepted.</p>  <p>Three days later, police said the woman's mother reported her missing after she failed to show up to a planned family outing. Over nearly two months, Latham said Evansville Police followed up on plenty of leads, ""they just never got the right lead,"" he said.</p>  <p>The ride with House on July 9 became a 40-mile drive to the mobile home he shared with girlfriend Kendra Tooley in the small town of Stewartsville and the victim decided she wanted to leave, according to a police affidavit. ""(The victim) got up to leave,"" Evansville detective Tony Mayhew recounted in court documents, but ""Ricky placed chloroform over her mouth and nose (which caused) her to lose consciousness. (The victim) awoke to find her clothing cut off and she was bound to a bed within the trailer.""</p>  <p>Throughout July and August, police said, House and Tooley kept their victim bound to the bed with zip ties or with ""an intricate restraint system."" Her captors treated her like a dog, forcing her to wear ""a red dog collar with a rope or leash attached to it,"" and forced her to stay inside a ""locked wooden cage"" that House built, according to court documents.</p>  <p>Throughout her captivity, she was raped and beaten, she told police. Tooley told police that House, whom she described as ""a sadist,"" was ""attempting to impregnate (the victim) because (Tooley) was old and unable to have children of her own.""</p>  <p>The victim was under constant restraint and supervision, according to police, and had seen nobody other than her captors until September 4, when Tooley invited her ex-husband to the trailer to show off the captive.</p>  <p>""(Tooley) slid over on the couch beside me and said 'I've got a girl back here in a cage.'

""</p>  <p>Read the U.S. Court of Appeals opinion on the case (PDF)</p>  <p>His experience raises nearly every issue that shapes America's capital punishment debate: DNA testing, mental retardation, a jailhouse snitch, incompetent defense lawyers, prosecutorial misconduct and ""a strong claim of innocence,"" said author Raymond Bonner , who wrote about the case in ""Anatomy of Injustice: A Murder Case Gone Wrong.""</p>  <p>In other words, a prime example of when ""innocence is not enough,"" Bonner said.</p>  <p>Elmore would probably still be on death row if not for Diana Holt, who began investigating his claims of innocence in 1993. When Holt met Elmore, she was surprised that a convicted killer on death row could be ""so docile and gentle.""</p>  <p>Two post-conviction review courts rejected Elmore's claims, though one noted that he ""may well not be guilty."" But Holt never considered giving up.</p>  <p>""If I throw in the towel, a client dies. If I stop working, they stop breathing,"" Holt said. ""Sometimes, I am the first person who ever stuck by them or treated them with respect.""</p>  <p>A bloody crime scene</p>  <p>Elmore was arrested in January 1982 for the rape and murder of Edwards, a wealthy widow in Greenwood, South Carolina. Edwards' longtime neighbor and friend, Greenwood City Councilman Jimmy Holloway, told police he let himself into her house after noticing newspapers piling up in her driveway.</p>  <p>Inside the house, he discovered her bloody corpse in a bedroom closet and alerted police. Holloway also identified Elmore, who had cleaned Edwards' windows and gutters the month before, as a possible suspect.</p>  <p>Within 48 hours, police arrested Elmore based on a thumbprint found on Edwards' back door. By April, a Greenwood County jury had convicted Elmore of murder and sentenced him to death. It would be the first of three times he would stand trial in the case, followed by years of appeals and post-conviction reviews.</p>  <p>When Holt took on the case, she says, she discovered a disturbing chain of events that led to Elmore's conviction, starting with law enforcement's willingness to build a case around Holloway's timeline. From there, Elmore's lawyers say, prosecutors suppressed blood and fingerprint evidence that could have cast doubt on their case. Instead, Elmore's lawyers claim that prosecutors deliberately introduced falsely incriminating statements from a jailhouse informant and hairs from Elmore that were not found at the crime scene.</p>  <p>A breakthrough finally came in 2011, when the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Elmore's conviction and ordered a new trial, based partly on findings that Elmore's trial lawyers blindly accepted the prosecution's case without bothering to examine the evidence in his first trial and retrial.</p>  <p>""A healthy skepticism of authority, while generally advisable, is an absolute necessity for a lawyer representing a client charged with capital murder,"" a judge wrote in the majority opinion. ""Elmore's lawyers disregarded their professional obligation to investigate critical prosecution evidence, thereby engendering 'a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.' ""</p>  <p>'Couldn't believe my eyes'</p>  <p>None of it would have come to light if not for Holt. She was in her mid-30s when she joined the case the summer before her third year of law school. Her journey to law school had been hard-fought, with a history of abusive relationships and a stint as a teen serving time in a Louisiana prison for armed robbery.</p>  <p>At 28, she began taking community college classes and earned the grades to enter Southwest Texas State University. Given her past, Holt was pleasantly surprised when the University of Texas accepted her law school application in 1991.</p>  <p>Her professors nudged her in the direction of death penalty litigation when she began to show a knack for the persistent digging the job demands. Through internships at the Texas Resource Center, Holt met lawyer John Blume, executive director of the South Carolina Death Penalty Resource Center. During an internship there, Blume asked her to help with Elmore's case by interviewing jurors.</p>  <p>""I started reading the trial testimony and couldn't believe my eyes,"" Holt said. ""All the forensic evidence evaporated under the smallest measure of scrutiny.""</p>  <p>She became immersed in the case, ""all Elmore, all the time,"" and ""classes became more like an annoying distraction,"" she said. Blume offered her a job as a staff attorney once she graduated, but she couldn't wait and moved to South Carolina before the final spring semester, for ""Elmore and John Blume,"" she said, half-joking.</p>  <p>A few things about the case jumped out at her.</p>  <p>For one, police said they had seized pubic hairs from Edwards' bed and identified them as belonging to Elmore.</p>  <p>If that was true, Holt wondered, where were crime scene photos of those hairs on the bed? Why weren't they packaged like other evidence taken from the scene? Why didn't investigators collect the bedsheets for further analysis? Elmore conceded that hairs introduced into trial evidence belonged to him but claimed that police pulled them from his head and groin area after his arrest.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, fibers and hairs collected from Edwards' body and marked ""item T"" on an evidence log were never introduced into evidence. For years, the state claimed they were missing, until 1998, when they were found in the private office of an investigator in the case. Testing revealed a ""Caucasian pubic hair inconsistent with Mrs. Edwards"" that Elmore's team claims could have cast doubt on the state's theory that he was the only possible killer.</p>  <p>Holloway's ""farcical"" trial testimony also led Holt to question his portrayal by prosecutors as a shocked neighbor and longtime friend. When Holt interviewed Holloway in 1993, within five minutes, she said, he told her, ""I am the only one who could kill her and get away with it, the way she trusted me so.""</p>  <p>Holloway died in 1994.</p>  <p>And yet, when Elmore walked out of prison in 2012, he was not fully exonerated.</p>  <p>Elmore agreed to a deal with prosecutors that allowed him to maintain his innocence while pleading guilty. In exchange for pleading guilty to murder, the state dropped a burglary charge and agreed to a 30-year sentence with credit for time served.</p>  <p>In the 2012 hearing, prosecutor Jerry Peace said that the state still believed it had a strong case against Elmore but that the victim's daughter supported the plea as a means of ending the case.</p>  <p>Read more about the plea deal (PDF)</p>  <p>Holt, however, told the court that his defense team believed Elmore is ""100% innocent"" but also sought to end the case. He could have gone to trial, but she has seen other clients wait years for a retrial. She also would have preferred an all-out acquittal, but ""immediate freedom stymied ongoing justice,"" she said.</p>  <p>""That the justice system provided an avenue for an immediate release to freedom for Mr. Elmore that was previously not available to him is more justice than injustice,"" she said.

When their other friends went away to college, the two rented an apartment and worked odd jobs.

The reason: Carolla was still bound to his CBS contract, which included a noncompete clause that kept them from soliciting revenue for the podcast during its first year.</p>  <p>Once the podcast started making money, Misraje contended, Carolla pushed him and the others out of the business.</p>  <p>Carolla, Geragos says, always maintained Misraje wasn't the only person who encouraged him to start a podcast. Carolla called Misraje a ""partner"" to humor him and honor their longstanding friendship, the lawyer said.</p>  <p>Carolla's popular podcast became the record holder, surpassing British comedian Ricky Gervais with nearly 60 million unique downloads between March 2009 and March 2011, according to Guinness World Records.</p> "

Whether it leads us to anyone else remains to be answered.""</p>  <p>The next step will be to put Harris' case on Superior Court Judge Mary Staley's arraignment calendar, which should happen within three weeks, the prosecutor said. Motions will then be filed before the case goes to a trial calendar.</p>  <p>Reynolds declined to take questions or comment further, saying, ""This case will be tried in a court of law,"" and not in the media.</p>  <p>If Reynolds seeks the death penalty, it will be for the malice murder charge, which alleges that Harris , who has claimed his son's death was an accident, premeditated the child's killing.</p>  <p>Harris' attorney, H. Maddox Kilgore, called the charges excessive, describing them as a part of the ""state's maze of theories.""</p>  <p>""It was always an accident. When the time comes, and we've worked through the state's maze of theories at trial, it's still going to be a terrible, gut-wrenching accident. And all the eccentricities and moral failings of Ross' life isn't going to change that,"" he told reporters.</p>  <p>The other five charges Harris faces are: first-degree cruelty to children, second-degree cruelty to children, criminal attempt to commit a felony (sexual exploitation of a minor) and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors.</p>  <p>According to the indictment, the grand jury found that on June 18, Harris ""did unlawfully, and with malice aforethought, cause the death of Cooper Harris ... by placing said Cooper Harris into a child car seat and leaving him alone in a hot motor vehicle.""</p>  <p>The two felony murder charges allege that Harris killed his 22-month-old son while committing the felonies of first- and second-degree cruelty to children. One count states he killed Cooper ""maliciously,"" while the other felony murder count says Harris killed him ""with criminal negligence.""</p>  <p>Harris faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted on any of the murder charges.</p>  <p>By leaving Cooper in the car, Harris caused the boy ""cruel and excessive physical pain,"" the cruelty to children charges allege.</p>  <p>The criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to Cooper's death. They involve allegations that Harris requested a nude photo of a minor's genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of ""sexual excitement and sexual conduct,"" according to the indictment.</p>  <p>A Cobb County detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while Cooper was in the car at his father's workplace, Harris was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them, who was underage, a photo of his erect penis.</p>  <p>Harris pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in June. Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox signed off on the charges, stating Harris would've had to notice that ""the stench in the car was overwhelming"" when he got in it as he left work and ""drove it for some instance"" before stopping to check on the boy.</p>  <p>Charges filed in an indictment supersede the previous charges. Harris has been held without bond since Cooper's death this summer.</p>  <p>Authorities have painted Harris as a terrible father who, after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child, purposely strapped his son into his sweltering SUV to die.</p>  <p>His motivation? The prosecutor has characterized Harris as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life.</p>  <p>Kilgore has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car. Friends described Harris as a doting dad, not a malicious one, who loved to show off his blond, bright-eyed boy and talked about him incessantly.</p>  <p>It all started simply enough: Harris left home with Cooper in a rear-facing car seat in the back of his 2011 Hyundai Tucson, then headed to his job as a Web developer for Atlanta-based Home Depot after making a quick stop at a fast-food restaurant for breakfast.</p>  <p>But he didn't follow through on his routine of stopping to drop the boy off at daycare.</p>  <p>Instead, according to a criminal warrant, Harris drove to work and left Cooper strapped in his car seat. He went back to his SUV during lunch, put something in the car, then returned to work.</p>  <p>All the while, the vehicle got increasingly hotter, with records showing the temperature topped 92 that day -- which can make the heat inside a closed vehicle soar past 100 degrees quickly.</p>  <p>Sometime around 4:15 p.m., seven hours after he'd arrived at work, Harris got back into his Hyundai and left work.

The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney's office told CNN it has no comment on the lawsuit.</p>  <p>The suit -- which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and battery -- details circumstances allegedly surrounding several arrests between August 11-13:</p>  <p>-- Tracey White was about to buy an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers ""in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and sticks and wearing helmets"" entered and ordered her to leave, according to the lawsuit. She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticizing officers for the way they were treating her son, the lawsuit claims.</p>  <p>-- Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges. He fell into a creek or sewer, the suit says, where officers ""pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned.""</p>  <p>-- Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, ""took out his memory card and threw it to the ground,"" the lawsuit says.</p>  <p>-- Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green were peacefully protesting, the lawsuit says, when police in riot gear fired tear gas and what appeared to be stun grenades in their direction, then ""hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time.""</p>  <p>CNN has not independently confirmed details of the arrests.</p>  <p>Police tactics to calm the crowds drew sharp criticism, including a rebuke from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.</p>  <p>""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder said as the protests unfolded.</p>  <p>As criticism of police tactics mounted, Gov.

That approach, he said, was much better than using nightsticks or dogs.</p>  <p>Even though President Barack Obama has called for a review of military equipment sales to local police departments in light of the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Belmar said that such equipment is often necessary.</p>  <p>""I never envisioned a day that we would ever see that kind of equipment used against protesters,"" he said.

""I decided no more violence. I didn't want my son to see him treat me that way.""</p>  <p>She left him two years ago and moved into her own place. She mostly kept the ordeal to herself until she found the courage to express herself in the Monument Quilt, a collection of hundreds of survival stories touring the country this summer.</p>  <p>Her words in Spanish are etched into a 4-foot red square that shares space with others' stories in a 16-foot square. When laid out in full, the squares of 250 stories of surviving rape and abuse stretch out to a 100-foot multicolored square.</p>  <p>""You told me that you loved me but now I know and I understand that I was raped,"" she says. ""I was your wife, not your property.""</p>  <p>The brainchild of Baltimore-based activist group "" Force: Upsetting Rape Culture ,"" the Monument Quilt project is making 13 stops in 12 states, displaying portions of the quilt in public spaces and growing its footprint through quilt-making workshops.</p>  <p>The goal of the project is to create healing spaces by and for survivors, said Rebecca Nagle, co-founder of Force.</p>  <p>The quilt evolved from discussions about how to create a permanent monument to survivors of rape, similar to memorials for war veterans, based on research showing how public monuments can help survivors recover from trauma, she said.</p>  <p>Quilting has a long history connected to social justice movements, perhaps most notably through the AIDS Memorial Quilt , which began touring the country in 1988 in remembrance of those who succumbed to the disease.</p>  <p>Nagle hopes bearing witness to the quilt will help erode stigma attached to rape, similar to the effect the AIDS quilt had on raising awareness around the disease.</p>  <p>""When we remove the stigma from rape and we're able to have public conversations and not blame the survivor, it's one step closer to curbing the epidemic.""</p>  <p>The presence of the quilt transforms parks, sports fields and town squares into reverential spaces for grieving and reflecting, said Karen Taylor, a Baltimore social worker who volunteers for Force.</p>  <p>""It creates a community holding space instead of the burden of trauma being on the shoulders of each individual supporter or survivor,"" Taylor said. ""It can be solidifying and reassuring. It can be lifting. It's not just on you anymore.""</p>  <p>Part of the healing comes from the collective impact of bearing witness to hundreds of survival stories. It also comes from creating the squares, some of which starts in workshops weeks before the Monument Quilt comes to town.</p>  <p>Force partnered with community-based prevention and public safety organizations, who made the quilt workshops part of their community outreach. South Dakota's White Buffalo Calf Women Society hosted workshops two weeks in advance of the quilt's arrival in White River, where it was displayed at a local high school.</p>  <p>Quilting is a cultural tradition of the Sioux tribe that inhabits the region, making it an ideal project for the community the shelter serves.</p>  <p>""It gave them a voice without putting them in the spotlight and I think that in itself was very powerful, and a good way to start the healing process,"" education outreach coordinator Summer Lunderman said.</p>  <p>""To stand in solidarity not only with our relatives here but with women in the U.S. was also very empowering for them and let them know they're not alone.""</p>  <p>Helping others with their squares brought up memories of Lunderman's experience being molested as a child. Her square reads, ""Lakota Women Are Sacred.""</p>  <p>""It created a safe space for me that I really needed.""</p>  <p>Witnessing the quilt inspired Baltimore activist Melanie Keller to bring to the surface her own history of being raped. Keller helped organize workshops through her work with anti-street harassment organization "" Hollaback! BMore ."" But she has never publicly identified herself as a rape survivor.</p>  <p>Too often stories of sexual harassment in the media focus on stranger danger, date rape or the experiences of white middle-class college students, she said. Seeing the diversity of experiences represented in the quilt inspired Keller, who is biracial, to make her own square.</p>  <p>""What I love about the whole project is the narrative of control by survivors,"" she said. ""It speaks to the diversity of different experiences who have gone through abuse and rape because we're the ones sharing those stories in the way we choose.""</p>  <p>Moreno says creating her square was cathartic. She hopes sharing her story will inspire others to ""free"" themselves of a despair she knows firsthand.</p>  <p>""Reading these words tells you yes, there is an opportunity to break the cycle of violence,"" she said.

Trim, petite, with a bob and easy smile, Scudo had enough energy to work full-time and preside over a large family in Denver.</p>  <p>She had it all -- until it crumbled.</p>  <p>Her dark secret about a taboo drug is not as isolated as it seems, especially with the revelations of public figures whose early deaths involved heroin , such as actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who overdosed on a cocktail of legal and illegal drugs.</p>  <p>Prescription drug abuse is now a health epidemic in America, worse than crack in the 1980s, and Scudo's story is one example. Her addiction to a handful of prescription drugs, with OxyContin as first and foremost, led to heroin because it gave her the same high at a cheaper price. Both are opiates.</p>  <p>""In the beginning, it was a feel-good,"" said Scudo, 55. ""At the end, it was black.""</p>  <p>Scudo didn't shoot heroin. Rather, she smoked it using a straw, tinfoil and a lighter to inhale a smaller than pea-sized pinch of ""black tar"" heroin. She exhaled the smoke through a fan vent in the basement bathroom of her home, sometimes at 2 a.m., so her children wouldn't smell anything.</p>  <p>""There's such a stigma about heroin, that it's dirty and it's IV users under the bridge and homeless people, and that is so not the case,"" Scudo said. ""Heroin crosses all borders, all socioeconomic groups.""</p>  <p>Scudo's addiction was far from unique. The path from prescription drugs to heroin is well traveled, according to Dr. Patrick Fehling, a psychiatrist at the University of Colorado Hospital's Center for Dependency, Addiction and Rehabilitation.</p>  <p>""That is very common. I have a lot of patients that ask me, 'Are prescription opioid painkillers gateway drugs towards heroin?'"" Fehling said. ""Absolutely.""</p>  <p>Scudo's drug use, while extreme, shouldn't obscure one reality: ""Prescription drug abuse is a massive problem in the United States,"" Fehling said.</p>  <p>How it began</p>  <p>For Scudo, her addiction began -- as they all do -- innocently enough.</p>  <p>She sought relief from hip pain, possibly caused by scarring from cesarean sections she had delivering several of her children.</p>  <p>Her then-husband recommended a physician.</p>  <p>""There was no physical therapy offered,"" she said of the doctor's visit. ""The first reaction was, let's give you some drugs.""</p>  <p>He put her on OxyContin.</p>  <p>By the second week, she was physically addicted.</p>  <p>She was popping so much of the painkiller and other drugs such as anti-anxiety Valium that they equated to a dosage for three men.</p>  <p>A second doctor reduced her prescription, causing Scudo to experience withdrawal symptoms, or become ""dope-sick.""</p>  <p>""When you start withdrawing from opiates, it focuses in your lower back and your legs, and it is like somebody has clamped a vice on both sides of your hips and is just smashing you. Hitting my back with a baseball bat would have been more comfortable,"" Scudo said.</p>  <p>She was desperate for more OxyContin.</p>  <p>""Some people are not addicts and can take drugs as prescribed,"" she explained. ""But for the few people who are addicts, it's a whole different ball game.""</p>  <p>To feed her cravings, Scudo leveraged her maternal authority: She found drug dealers who were friends of her eldest children.</p>  <p>""When you have eight children,"" she said, ""you're bound to know people.""</p>  <p>It was so easy.</p>  <p>But it was also so expensive. One OxyContin pill cost $80 on the street.</p>  <p>""One OxyContin wouldn't last me at all,"" she said. ""I could never take just one OxyContin. That wouldn't even keep the dope-sick away.""</p>  <p>So she turned to heroin.</p>  <p>Why?</p>  <p>Her fear of withdrawal was greater than her fear of the drug.</p>  <p>Living fearlessly</p>  <p>Like OxyContin, heroin was abundant on the street. In Denver. In the suburbs.</p>  <p>Once you bought from one dealer, several more approached you, she said.</p>  <p>She bought seven balloons -- or seven grams -- of heroin for $100, she said. That kept her high for up to three days.</p>  <p>""I would do some crazy stuff to get drugs,"" she said. ""Like 2 o'clock in the morning, I'm making a run to downtown Denver. Like picking up my grandkids in the car (to go to a drug deal), praying that I was not going to get busted.""</p>  <p>No risk was too great.</p>  <p>Never did she think of what she had to lose.</p>  <p>""Not once,"" she explained. ""That's the addict in me.""</p>  <p>After almost 10 years of heroin addiction, she wondered how much her family knew. Her children stopped bringing the grandchildren to visit her. She pawned family heirlooms. Her second marriage failed, and she stole from her ex-husband.</p>  <p>""I know they knew that I was struggling, but they didn't know how to help. I'm sure that they were scared to death for me,"" she said, ""and the sad part is...I didn't care.""</p>  <p>She fooled herself. After all, she was good at lying. Her job was going well. The bosses promoted her a few times. Everything was manageable, except when she got home from work at 4 p.m. and was in bed for the night at 4:30 p.m.</p>  <p>""I didn't want to think. I didn't want to feel. Actually I didn't care if I lived or died,"" she said.</p>  <p>The only person she couldn't fool was her alcoholic mom in recovery, who noticed Scudo's weight loss and asked her, ""Are you ready for help?""</p>  <p>Scudo responded with an ""I got this, mom, I got it.""</p>  <p>I went from heroin addict to PTA mom</p>  <p>What the mirror told her</p>  <p>The breaking point came one morning after taking a shower.</p>  <p>Scudo looked at herself in a full-length mirror, naked, for the first time in six months.</p>  <p>""I looked like an Auschwitz survivor,"" she said. ""I was a skeleton. I had this lovely green glow going, so I knew my liver was shutting down. The skin was hanging, literally hanging off my body.</p>  <p>""And something about that moment when I saw myself triggered something in my head,"" she said.</p>  <p>The next day, her ex-husband called her at work in a confrontation about a problem. Scudo had enough. She wanted to drive her car off the highest overhang on Interstate 70, but feared she wouldn't die immediately and would end up in pain. She went home, kissed the two children still living with her, went to the bedroom and cried. She closed the door. She found eight OxyContin pills, but that wasn't going to be enough to kill her. She was used to downing six at a time, crushed.</p>  <p>She fell asleep and took a sick day from work the next morning.</p>  <p>How heroin kills you</p>  <p>Hitting bottom</p>  <p>Her mother knocked on her door at 10 a.m. Her son-in-law, who worked at the same company as Scudo, told her that Scudo took a sick day.</p>  <p>""Have you damn well had enough?"" her mother asked her.</p>  <p>""And for some reason, 'yes' came out of my mouth,"" Scudo said.</p>  <p>They checked her into a 30-day inpatient program for addiction on April 19, 2011, the last day she took drugs.</p>  <p>That meant her first day without dope was, ironically, also the unofficial, international get-high day of April 20, she noted.</p>  <p>Her detoxification was ""six days of hell,"" she said.</p>  <p>""I lost 9 pounds in six days,"" she recounted. ""I threw up every 15 minutes. I would have to live in the shower with the water temperature of 120 degrees to burn the skin to not feel the pain in my back.""</p>  <p>She's been clean for three years now, she said.</p>  <p>She's on her third marriage.</p>  <p>She's changed jobs, becoming an office manager over 200 employees at a credit card company.</p>  <p>And she no longer wants to die.</p>  <p>""I am not ashamed of the fact that I am who I am. The only way that I will not make this is if I start keeping secrets from myself and other people and then my head gets to start playing games with me and telling me it has a good idea,"" Scudo said. ""And I have got way too much to live for to go back.""</p>  <p>She now hosts a monthly family dinner -- for 45 people in her little green house.</p>  <p>And the grandchildren visit again the once-lost matriarch.</p>  <p>New abuse-deterrent painkiller approved</p>  <p>FDA aims to tighten control of hydrocodone</p>  <p>FDA fights drug overdoses with new labels for prescription painkillers</p>  <p>DEA turns to texting to fight prescription drug abuse</p> "

A close look at the official arrest logs of the St. Louis County police, which CNN obtained Friday, shows that while some people did travel to Ferguson to protest the shooting of a black teen by a white police officer , a majority of the people arrested live in the St. Louis area.</p>  <p>More than half of them were charged with a relatively minor offense: refusing to disperse when asked by police.</p>  <p>Read the arrest log (PDF)</p>  <p>Ferguson is a small suburban town, just 21,000 people packed into six square miles flush against St. Louis International Airport. The unrest started when unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death August 9 by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. Anger over the shooting, and the Ferguson police department's initial refusal to identify the officer who shot Brown, set off nightly confrontations between police and protesters.</p>  <p>The worst violence came nine days after the shooting: on Monday into the wee hours of Tuesday. Police responded in militarized fashion, firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd and confiscating firearms, Molotov cocktails and, reportedly, water bottles filled with urine. There was sporadic looting.</p>  <p>Where is Officer Darren Wilson?</p>  <p>The force of the police response has been sharply criticized. But the finger-pointing went both ways. Some officials in Ferguson blamed outsiders for stirring up trouble.</p>  <p>A deeper dive into the arrest logs and a search of social media and online news accounts show some self-avowed ""communists"" and others who could be considered ""agitators."" But the vast majority of arrestees who gave out-of-town addresses were college students, peaceniks, legal advisers and journalists.</p>  <p>The logs compiled by the St. Louis County police cover August 10 through 22 and list 212 arrests in Ferguson. They can't tell the full story, since they do not include arrests made by Ferguson police. They do not identify the arrestees by age or race. No incident reports are attached to provide details.</p>  <p>Ferguson residents say police have a 'power trip problem'</p>  <p>But the numbers do tell this simple story: 130 people were charged with refusal to disperse, 18 or so with burglary -- which may or may not be related to looting -- and nine with disorderly conduct. A handful of people were charged with resisting arrest and two people were charged with careless driving.</p>  <p>And, 20 people appear to have made a serious tactical error by joining the crowd in Ferguson: They were picked up on existing arrest or fugitive warrants.</p>  <p>Seven of the people arrested were journalists trying to cover the story . The list does not include reporters from the Washington Post and Huffington Post, who were arrested in the early days of the protests. It does include a Getty photographer who was arrested, along with several international journalists and representatives from online media sites. An eighth was a college senior, a journalism major photographing the protests for a newspaper in Cincinnati.</p>  <p>Thursday night saw an eerie quiet descend, and the number of arrests dropped sharply; only eight were reported.</p>  <p>Out of the glare, under the noise, other voices tell of a town called Ferguson</p>  <p>What we know about Ferguson</p> "

""The Earth is a rock and everything else on it is ATWA.""</p>  <p>Why people still pay attention to Manson</p>  <p>After a few years of sending letters and talking to Manson on the phone, Star, at age 19, moved to Corcoran, a small central California city that's home to Corcoran State Prison, where Charles Manson has lived for the past 25 years.</p>  <p>She talks to Manson almost every day by phone and visits him on most weekends.</p>  <p>""We talk about anything and everything, you know, like what's going' on today-- who's doing what.

"157","Abortion law ruling a win for women","CNN.com","2014-08-05 00:37:10","2014-10-06 05:14:49","http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/04/opinion/jennings-alabama-abortion/index.html","Justice"," <p>As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine.</p>  <p>Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws (a number of states have adopted them) do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety.</p>  <p>That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them.</p>  <p>Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications.</p>  <p>For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare.</p>  <p>Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis.</p>  <p>It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period.</p>  <p>In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations.</p>  <p>Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals.</p>  <p>As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin.</p>  <p>These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible.</p>  <p>Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine .</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

I have something to say to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.</p>  <p>Dear Roger,</p>  <p>We thought you really cared. We believed you when you said you wanted to create a more welcoming NFL game for women.</p>  <p>And all of us were touched by the compassion you showed with your Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, even though those hot pink cleats disturbingly clashed with every NFL uniform. Mr. Commissioner, you even talked endlessly about making NFL stadiums around the nation more family-friendly.</p>  <p>And despite all the disturbing medical reports of NFL players with life-threatening concussions, you have worked tirelessly to try to convince us moms that the game remains safe for our precious sons. (I forgave you for stretching the truth past all the medical evidence on that one.) And still, we thought: Now that man really cares. What a guy.</p>  <p>We repaid your good deeds by watching the games in record numbers, helping the league boost its television ratings. We even started turning up at stadiums around the nation and buying all those form-fitting team-branded outfits now made for women.</p>  <p>The NFL reported earnings of more than $9 billion last year , thanks in large part to women, who make up nearly 45% of the league's fan base.</p>  <p>So, knowing you as we do, there was no doubt that you'd send down the harshest penalty possible for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after he was caught on camera dragging his then-fiancee, Janay, like a rag doll out of the elevator.</p>  <p>Surely, you, like all the rest of us, must have been appalled by Rice's actions. Roger will handle it, we thought. No way the commissioner who prides himself on being tough on players who step out of line will let this atrocious behavior go unpunished.</p>  <p>What fools we have been. A two-game suspension? You repay our loyalty with an insult? And you expect us to accept that -- to keep on supporting your game? Not happening here. You've shown us your true face. And sadly, you, Mr. Commissioner are a fake, a fraud, a liar. Turns out you never really cared about women at all.</p>  <p>Where is the indignation and outrage you showed the world when handing down the indefinite suspension for NFL quarterback Michael Vick in 2007 after he admitted his role in a dogfighting ring?</p>  <p>""Your admitted conduct is not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. ... Your team, fans and the NFL have all been hurt by your actions,"" you wrote to Vick in a formal letter from the league. ""Your career, freedom and your public standing are now in the most serious jeopardy. I hope that you will be able to learn from this difficult experience and emerge from it better prepared to act responsibly and to make the kinds of choices that are expected of a conscientious and law-abiding citizen.""</p>  <p>By your lights, it sounds like dogs are more important than women. Or perhaps you subscribe to the philosophy of my misguided colleague, sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who raised the issue of whether Rice's wife somehow brought an ""element of provocation"" into the situation.</p>  <p>Rightfully, Smith was suspended for a week by ESPN. But at least he has faced his critics. You, Mr. Goodell, were hiding out in your NFL ivory tower until you were forced to face the league's female fans and try to defend the indefensible.</p>  <p>It's good to know where we stand with you now, Roger. We should have known that you were just stringing us along. Saying all the right words. Sadly, we love this game so much it was easy to look the other way. Easy to believe.</p>  <p>But you've gone too far. It's time for us to fight back. I'm declaring week three, Sunday, September 21, 1:00 p.m. an NFL blackout day in my house. That's the game when Rice is scheduled to return to the field after serving his paltry suspension. And I'm urging every woman I know to do the same. The blackout continues until we hear your apology.</p>  <p>You don't take 45% of your customers for granted. Because, in case you didn't know, Roger, without women watching the NFL, you lose.</p>  <p>And we are keeping score.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

Ibeagwa left her children unsupervised while she went to work at her second-shift job.

Harrell had been allowing the girl to play there while she worked at a McDonald's a mile and a half away.</p>  <p>Here are some more recent examples:</p>  <p>In North Carolina, a mother was arrested after leaving her 5- and 11-year-olds alone for 2½ hours.</p>  <p>A Connecticut mother was arrested when her 7-year-old, who wasn't wearing a helmet, suffered head injuries after falling off his scooter.</p>  <p>In Pennsylvania, a mother died in jail while serving a 48-hour sentence after she couldn't pay fines incurred for the truancy of some of her seven children.</p>  <p>In Ohio, a father was arrested when his 8-year-old gave the church bus the slip and played with neighborhood friends instead of going to youth group.</p>  <p>And then just this week, a mother in Florida was arrested after allowing her 7-year-old to walk half a mile to a neighborhood park. The boy even had a cell phone to call home if he got into trouble.</p>  <p>What's going on here?</p>  <p>From one perspective, we're criminalizing poverty. Some of the parents I mentioned above clearly acted out of economic necessity. In our post-recession economy, good jobs are hard to come by and child care is expensive. For low-wage earners, child care costs can easily eclipse earning potential.</p>  <p>In Taylor's case, she had previously been offered a full-time job, but child care costs would have left her with less income than she was able to earn by picking up a few hours here and there.</p>  <p>A news report in the Harrell case quoted another parent who said , ""I understand the mom may have been in a difficult situation, not having someone to watch the child, but at the same time, you've got to find somebody."" It sounds as though she is suggesting that having some unqualified person to stay home alone with the daughter would somehow be better than letting her play in the park, surrounded by other children and parents.</p>  <p>I'm not a parent, but I am a board-certified family law attorney, and I frequently deal with families facing difficult decisions. The truth is that too many parents are finding themselves having to make a desperate choice between providing for their children and caring for their children. Unless you've been put in that situation, I don't think you're entitled to judge.</p>  <p>I grew up in Queens in the '60s -- during a time when crime in New York was notoriously on the rise. My father was a battalion chief for the New York Fire Department, and he worked two other jobs to support our family. My mother worked hard to keep my two sisters, my two brothers (and me) in line. She was an amazing mother but didn't always succeed in keeping us out of hot water.</p>  <p>We were allowed to play unsupervised in our neighborhood, and sometimes we got in trouble. But my mother knew we were with other neighborhood kids. She knew other adults in our neighborhood kept tabs on us and would look out for us. She expected that if we got into real trouble, we'd encounter a police officer, and that officer would deliver us home -- and it did happen from time to time.</p>  <p>I'm concerned that in the average neighborhood today -- where the crime rate is far lower than it was in the 1960s -- adults are not looking out for neighborhood kids. Instead of helping a youngster who may be in trouble, they're calling the cops. And the police, instead of bringing children home, they're handing them over to child services and arresting the parents.</p>  <p>Last week, prosecutors offered Taylor a deal : After she completes a parenting plan, which includes six months of counseling, they will drop the felony charges. But Taylor now has to fight to regain custody of her children.</p>  <p>In South Carolina, Harrell has been reunited with her daughter but still faces criminal prosecution, and she lost her job as a result of the arrest. In Florida, Ibeagwa is out of jail now -- after suffering the double tragedy of losing her children and enduring incarceration for her role in the misfortune.</p>  <p>Elsewhere other children are being taken from their parents, and families are being torn apart.</p>  <p>I have to wonder if my mom, who I think was a wonderful mother, would face criminal charges if she were alive and raising children in today's world -- if she raised them the way she raised my brothers and sisters and me.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

And the decision issued later Tuesday by another federal appellate court -- the 4th Circuit -- in King v. Burwell makes clear why: The D.C. Circuit's decision got basically everything wrong. It misunderstood the text, structure and purpose of the Affordable Care Act. The Justice Department has already indicated that it will ask the entire D.C. Circuit to review the Halbig v. Burwell decision, and when it does, it will no doubt reverse it.</p>  <p>These two cases are both part of what Judge Harry Edwards, the dissenting judge in Halbig, termed a ""not-so-veiled attempt to gut"" the Affordable Care Act. As the members of Congress who led the enactment of the law made clear in a ""friend of the court"" brief they submitted to both courts this year, the fundamental purpose of the statute was to achieve universal health care coverage, and the Internal Revenue Service providing tax credits that act as subsidies so low- and middle-income Americans can pay for health care is central to doing so.</p>  <p>The plaintiffs in these challenges argue that these tax credits should not be available to people who buy insurance in the 36 states with exchanges operated by the federal government -- that is, who got their subsidized health coverage through HealthCare.gov , not a state-run exchange. It's a position that's not only completely without legal merit -- ""tortured"" and ""nonsensical,"" according to one of the 4th Circuit judges -- it's also one that would critically undermine how Obamacare works.</p>  <p>What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you</p>  <p>But rather than looking at the law as a whole and considering what it was attempting to accomplish, the D.C. Circuit judges focused on one small provision of what is a long and complicated statute. Edwards called the plaintiffs' argument ""illogical when cast in the context of the statute as a whole.""</p>  <p>Indeed, the plaintiffs themselves appeared to recognize how flawed their argument, based on the statute's language, was and thus manufactured an explanation for why Congress would have written the statute to eliminate the tax credits on federally facilitated exchanges. According to the plaintiffs, Congress wanted to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges. The only problem, as Edwards noted, is that the ""claim is nonsense, made up out of whole cloth."" The legal reasoning in the majority's opinion is so weak it is difficult to understand it as anything but a political decision.</p>  <p>And that is what makes particularly galling the judges' professed ""reluctance"" to reach their conclusion. These judges assert that their hands were tied by the ""limited"" role of judges in our democratic system. In other words, they imply, their decision -- which could have massive consequences for millions of Americans -- was actually an exercise of judicial restraint.</p>  <p>Appeals courts differ on Obamacare</p>  <p>There's nothing restrained about misreading a law's text, disregarding its structure and ignoring its purpose. In fact, it was the 4th Circuit judges who exercised true judicial restraint. Two of those judges concluded that the statute was unclear and that they should therefore defer to the agencies charged with implementing the law -- in this case, the IRS, which would provide the tax credit subsidies. (The other judge concluded that the statute is unambiguous, but in the other direction, and requires that tax credits be available on federally facilitated exchanges.)</p>  <p>As those judges recognized, where a law is unclear, the proper role of a judge is generally to defer to a reasonable construction offered by the executive branch agencies charged with implementing the statute.</p>  <p>The judges in Halbig seemed so determined to undermine the Affordable Care Act that they ignored this bedrock legal principle. Fortunately, they won't have the last word on the subject.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</p> "

Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators. He entered the NFL draft after his junior year and was selected by the Patriots in the fourth round.</p>  <p>By the end of the second season, he inked a five-year contract extension worth $40 million. But less than a year later, he was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Odin Lloyd. Two hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team.</p>  <p>Hernandez has also been charged in the slayings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, and some of his closest associates are facing serious charges in connection with the alleged crimes.</p>  <p>Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and is expected to go on trial next year. Here is a primer on some of the names you might be hearing about ahead of his trials:</p>  <p>Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez</p>  <p>Odin Lloyd</p>  <p>Odin Lloyd was a 27-year-old semi-pro football player. He was found dead on June 17, 2013, less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He had been shot seven times. Lloyd met Hernandez while dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating Lloyd's execution.</p>  <p>Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado</p>  <p>Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed outside a Boston nightclub on July 16, 2012. Prosecutors say de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, spilling a drink. Later that night, Hernandez was driving an SUV and allegedly pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a .38-caliber revolver at them.</p>  <p>Alexander Bradley</p>  <p>Alexander Bradley is a former friend of Hernandez who was allegedly with Hernandez on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. He is not facing any charges in that case, but he is jailed on unrelated charges. He is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in February 2013. Bradley claims Hernandez accused him of ""disrespecting him"" over a cell phone left in a Miami strip club.</p>  <p>Carlos Ortiz</p>  <p>Carlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death Odin Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty. A law enforcement source said he cooperated with police and described the night of Lloyd's death.</p>  <p>Ernest Wallace</p>  <p>Ernest Wallace, nicknamed Hobo, is also charged with murder in the death of Odin Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors call him the ""muscle man"" for Hernandez. They say he was in the car with Hernandez, Lloyd and Carlos Ortiz an hour before the car is seen on video heading to the industrial park where Lloyd was killed.</p>  <p>Shayanna Jenkins</p>  <p>Shayanna Jenkins is Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his daughter. She is charged with perjury , allegedly lying to a grand jury about guns in their home. She has pleaded not guilty. Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Odin Lloyd at the time of his death.</p>  <p>Shaneah Jenkins</p>  <p>Shaneah Jenkins is the girlfriend of Odin Lloyd. Her sister is Hernandez's fiancée. In court, the two sisters sit on opposite sides, Shayanna with the defense and Shaneah with the prosecution.</p>  <p>Tanya Cummings-Singleton</p>  <p>Tanya Cummings-Singleton is a cousin of Hernandez. In her garage, police found the SUV allegedly driven by Hernandez and linked to the 2012 Boston double homicide. She was twice charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify before two grand juries despite immunity offers. She has pleaded guilty to obstruction in the Lloyd case. She is also suffering from cancer.</p>  <p>Thaddeus Singleton</p>  <p>Thaddeus Singleton, husband of Tanya Cummings-Singleton, was killed in a car accident after Lloyd's slaying. Police say his speeding car went airborne and crashed. A source says police planned to interview him about his relationship with Hernandez.</p>  <p>Shaquilla Thibou</p>  <p>Shaquilla Thibou is the sister of Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors say she saw her brother get into a car with Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz before he was killed. Prosecutors say she received a text from her brother that night telling her he was with ""Nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know.""</p>  <p>Terri Hernandez</p>  <p>Terri Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's mother. She is a school secretary.</p>  <p>Dennis Hernandez</p>  <p>Dennis Hernandez was Aaron Hernandez's father. He had a close relationship with his sons and was deeply involved in their sports training. He died unexpectedly after hernia surgery when Hernandez was 16.</p>  <p>DJ Hernandez</p>  <p>DJ Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's older brother. He was a star high school athlete. He also was a standout athlete at the University of Connecticut and now is an assistant coach at the University of Iowa.</p>  <p>Andrew Booker</p>  <p>Andrew Booker shared a jail unit with Aaron Hernandez. The two allegedly got into a jail fight , and Hernandez was indicted in Booker's assault.</p>  <p>The prosecution</p>  <p>District Attorney Samuel Sutter is leading the prosecution against Hernandez, along with William McCauley and Patrick Bomberg. ""Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,"" Sutter told CNN.</p>  <p>The defense</p>  <p>Attorneys James Sultan, Michael Fee and Charles Rankin are handling Hernandez's defense.

She said that Utah ""was drowning in prescription pill addiction."" Shannon divulged that she had actually been abusing heroin for some time, but -- as with most people with addiction problems in Utah -- it all started with pills.</p>  <p>Out of all 50 states, Utah ranks eighth in the number of prescription drugs overdose deaths, according to Susannah Burt with the state's Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health . And, despite a dip in 2008, the number of pill-related deaths in Utah over the past decade has increased by 400%, according to Burt.</p>  <p>I have always thought Utah had low levels of addiction because of the influence of its large Mormon population -- more than 60% of those living there are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I've even known Mormons there who don't drink coffee in deference to their religion's ""Word of Wisdom,"" a health law that strongly discourages people from consuming things that are harmful to their bodies.</p>  <p>You'd have to be hiding under a rock to not know how highly addictive prescription pills can be . And people in Utah, who have statistically speaking been successful at maintaining healthier lives , are no less vulnerable. In fact, because medications are prescribed by a physician, the assumption often is that they're OK.</p>  <p>Many people who've been able to maintain diligence in upholding the LDS Word of Wisdom have fallen victim to pill addiction because of the gray area that doctor-prescribed pills inhabit.</p>  <p>While the Mormon church hierarchy certainly isn't proud of the exploding numbers, it didn't hide from the issue, giving us access to talk to those dealing with the struggles of addiction.</p>  <p>Earlier this year, we spent 12 days in Utah with church leaders and people in recovery as well as people deep in the throes of addiction. I met people who wore their hearts on their sleeves who shared some of their most painful moments.</p>  <p>They allowed me into their worlds because they acknowledge pill addiction is a huge problem within their community and they know they need help.</p>  <p>The people I spent time with are incredibly brave -- particularly Shannon who I'm happy to report has been clean for quite awhile now.

Does the law impermissibly infringe on the President's power to recognize a foreign nation?</p>  <p>THE CASE: Thirteen-year-old Menachem Zivotofsky is a U.S. citizen, and his parents want his birthplace listed as ""Jerusalem, Israel,"" but U.S. diplomatic officials said they could use only ""Jerusalem."" The status of the holy city remains in dispute, and U.S. policy is reflected in the fact that it does not currently recognize any country as having sovereignty over the region.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: The justices three years ago allowed the lawsuit by the family to proceed. It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the holy city, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital: The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: This dispute may be fact-specific, but the federal government is thinking of the bigger political and diplomatic picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record in a pending case, but President Barack Obama has acknowledged that the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the United States.</p>  <p>WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION : Young v. United Parcel Service</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: The duty of employers to provide workplace accommodations under the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Expectant mother Peggy Young's request for a ""light duty"" assignment from her regular work as a truck driver was denied, even though the company allegedly had done so for other workers temporarily unable to perform their functions. Young, who worked in suburban Washington, then had to take unpaid leave, with a subsequent loss of medical benefits.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: The company and Young focus on two different readings of the act and whether UPS' ""pregnancy-blind"" policy on the ability to work protects it from liability.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: The ruling could add significantly to the evolving canon of judicial oversight over job discrimination claims.</p>  <p>Cases that may be added to the Supreme Court docket in coming months:</p>  <p>SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: Various pending appeals from state officials in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: Whether state bans on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantees.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Thirty-one states do not allow same-sex marriage. Legal, political and social momentum favoring the right has accelerated in the past year after the Supreme Court in a peripheral case struck down part of a congressional law that recognized marriage for federal purposes as between only one man and one woman.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: Gay rights groups say the bans are discriminatory and single out homosexuals for disparate treatment. But many states say that the voters -- not the courts -- should decide such matters and that traditional marriage encourages opposite-sex couples to raise children in a stable family unit.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: A final ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court would be a landmark on many social levels. The justices could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or they could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures to sort it all out, for now.</p>  <p>ABORTION RIGHTS: Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: A challenge to a Texas law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a clinic where they are providing abortion services.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Other states have adopted similar laws, and lower courts have issued conflicting rulings.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: Abortion-rights supporters say the provision is unconstitutionally restrictive and has forced more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas to close. State officials, including Gov. Rick Perry, have said the law ensures that clinics are no operating under ""dangerous conditions.""</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: Another part of the Texas law is also being reviewed by a federal appeals court: the requirement that abortions be provided in only walk-in hospital-type surgical centers, which could force closure of many smaller women's health clinics. 11 other states have similar restrictions. If the case is accepted for review, the justices will again tackle one of the most contentious social issues.</p>  <p>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: Fisher v. University of Texas</p>  <p>AT ISSUE: A renewed challenge to the school's race-conscious admissions policies.</p>  <p>THE CASE: Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she a high senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Fisher claims that she was turned away because she is white. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors -- such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus.</p>  <p>THE ARGUMENTS: The high court first heard this case two years ago, issuing a ruling with no clear winner. The justices affirmed the limited use of race in the admissions process but made it somewhat harder for institutions to apply such policies to achieve diversity. The case went back to a federal appeals court for further scrutiny, which decided in the school's favor in July.</p>  <p>THE IMPACT: The Fisher dispute will now probably be reviewed once again by the Supreme Court in coming months, with the potential for a definitive 21st-century ruling. The issue of race and education offers vexing questions of competition, fairness and demographics -- and what role government should play when promoting political and social diversity.</p> "

Simpson ruled Wednesday that there was no evidence that former New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro acted with bias toward the defendant when the verdict was rendered.</p>  <p>The case was revisited after Barbaro, a longtime champion of civil rights, said he believed that he denied a fair trial to a white man who claimed he killed a black man in self-defense.</p>  <p>In a bench trial in October 1999, Donald Kagan said he was acting in self-defense when he shot Wavell Wint, 23, during a confrontation at a Brooklyn movie theater 11 months before.</p>  <p>""The evidence demonstrates that Justice Barbaro applied considerable effort in his deliberations and issued a written decision,"" Simpson said in the decision.</p>  <p>Simpson ruled that Barbaro's claims of bias and prejudice were ""mere afterthoughts or second guesses.""</p>  <p>Simpson wrote that was it troubling that it took Barbaro 13 years to ""express his concern that he may have been biased and prejudice.""</p>  <p>The verdict, she ruled, should only be vacated with ""compelling and credible evidence that the fact finder acted improperly as a matter of law.""</p>  <p>On the issues of Kagan's proclaimed innocence, Simpson wrote that Kagan failed to meet his ""burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he is actually innocent for the crimes he was convicted.""</p>  <p>Barbaro, who is white, found Kagan guilty of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.

The mother will face charges in Travis County, Texas, said Dan Powers, an FBI assistant special agent in charge in San Antonio, Texas.</p>  <p>So much time has passed that Allen's daughter is all but grown, now 17 years old. Moreover, his daughter has been told over the years that her father was ""a bad guy"" and ""a wife beater"" -- all false accusations, Allen declared.</p>  <p>But Allen never gave up hope.</p>  <p>He began a website dedicated to his daughter: FindSabrina.org , which offered a $20,000 reward. He hired a private investigator. And he pressed his public campaign so relentlessly that people wondered whether he was going too far.</p>  <p>""I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,"" Allen said of his pursuit. ""I've had people say, ""Of course, she's with her mother; what's the big deal?'</p>  <p>""People just don't understand,"" he said. ""I was accused of overstepping my bounds.""</p>  <p>A confidential informant</p>  <p>On Wednesday, Allen was euphoric over his daughter's recovery. He learned the news while at the dentist Tuesday and had to rinse his mouth. The police action resulted in a minor injury to a federal Mexican police officer who was involved in the arrest of Llorens, 44, according to Philip Klein, a private investigator retained by Allen.</p>  <p>Llorens was located in Mexico through information from a confidential informant, Klein said.</p>  <p>But Sabrina Allen has been through so much emotional trauma that she isn't allowed to immediately see her father. She's in solid physical health but hasn't been in school for a while, her father said. She is now under the care of a clinical psychologist in Texas.</p>  <p>""I haven't gotten to see her yet,"" Greg Allen said Wednesday.</p>  <p>""She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,"" he said, becoming tearful. ""She's just not ready to see me and my family. I hope and pray that's coming soon, and I can't predict it.""</p>  <p>He described the 12-year hunt for his daughter as a tormenting odyssey.</p>  <p>""It's a long road.

""I told myself the hardest thing to learn was that I could have a life while looking for her.""</p>  <p>When Sabrina Allen is eventually allowed to reunite with her father, she will discover that she has a new family who has heard so much about her but has never met her: Greg Allen's new wife and their children.</p>  <p>""We hope to have her home as soon as possible,"" Allen said.</p>  <p>How his daughter was taken from him began on April 19, 2002, according to the website dedicated to his once-missing daughter.</p>  <p>A weekend outing</p>  <p>On that day, Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with her daughter during a scheduled weekend visit, the FBI said in its wanted bulletin for Llorens.</p>  <p>Llorens was supposed to return the daughter to her father two days later. He was the primary guardian, the FBI said.</p>  <p>The father's website doesn't specify why the relationship between him and Llorens didn't work out, but the site alleges that Llorens has a mental illness.</p>  <p>""Dara's court ordered psychological evaluation indicated that she has a well-established personality disorder, and that she is likely to act in her own interest, instead of Sabrina's,"" the website charges.</p>  <p>Llorens and her attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.</p>  <p>On the day Llorens was scheduled to return Sabrina, the mother failed to appear at the pickup site, the FBI said.</p>  <p>Llorens had moved from her residence in north Austin and left a false forwarding address, the father's website said. Llorens didn't even contact work when she disappeared with Sabrina Allen, the webpage said.</p>  <p>Warrants and wanted posters</p>  <p>Later that month, a Texas warrant was issued for Llorens, accusing her of interference with child custody, and then a federal warrant was issued in May 2002, charging Llorens with unlawful flight, authorities said.</p>  <p>Llorens even became wanted by the FBI, which published a public bulletin describing her as someone who ""may walk with a mild limp"" and ""may have travelled to Mexico, where she has ties."" On his website, Greg Allen described her as a thin, petite woman who ""typically does not keep a job for more than six months"" and ""may be likely to take a retail sales job.""</p>  <p>Sabrina Allen was listed on the FBI poster as every bit a little girl: 3-foot-6 and 35 pounds, with pierced ears, a mole on her right knee and a small scar on the bridge of her nose.</p>  <p>See a copy of the FBI wanted poster (PDF)</p>  <p>Her father described her as a cheerful child who liked ""Barbies, bugs, dress-up, movies, Snow White and Scooby-Doo.""</p>  <p>""Sabrina has many friends and a large, loving family in Austin. She is very dearly missed,"" the father's website says.</p>  <p>The case briefly came to the attention of CNN in November 2002, when host John Walsh of ""America's Most Wanted"" appeared on the network.</p>  <p>When Walsh was told that Sabrina Allen had been missing seven months, he said, ""We have a chance of getting her back. She was taken by her ... mother, and that little girl we may be able to get back. But it's by pictures ... that's how we get missing children back, by exposure like this.""</p>  <p>Meanwhile, her father pressed authorities and media outlets about his missing daughter. He even posted photo galleries of him and his daughter on the website.</p>  <p>""This is my school picture. My Daddy says, 'What a big girl,' "" one photo caption says.</p>  <p>""It's my fourth birthday. Who says I'm not a princess?"" another says.</p>  <p>Trying to hide in Mexico</p>  <p>While his daughter and her mother lived in Mexico, the girl went by ""Blanquita,"" the diminutive of Blanca, one of the several aliases that Llorens was using, according to the father's website said. The FBI also alleged that Llorens used many aliases.</p>  <p>Despite the use of Spanish names, the father asserted that his daughter and her mother would not have blended in Mexican society: Lloren's Spanish was ""poor,"" and their daughter ""does not look at all Hispanic,"" the father said on his website.</p>  <p>In fact, Sabrina Allen's middle name is Fair.</p>  <p>""It is unlikely that they could hide in a Hispanic community without standing out,"" Allen said on his website.</p>  <p>But Sabrina Allen was repeatedly disguised, right down to her eyebrows and eyelashes, which were dyed, as was her hair, the website said.</p>  <p>Sabrina's natural blonde hair was colored red and other hues on varying occasions, the father's website said.</p>  <p>As friendly and outgoing as the little girl was, the act of being spirited away imposed an emotional toll on her, the website charges.</p>  <p>""It is reported that she is sometime(s) distant and burdened with the secrets she is being made to keep,"" the website said. ""It is reported that Sabrina has lost weight and is suffering physically and psychologically.""</p>  <p>At one point, Llorens apparently enrolled her daughter in the preschool Tegui in Colonia del Valle in Mexico City, and Sabrina reportedly learned how to speak Spanish ""very well"" and to read and write the language, the father's website said.</p>  <p>A promising moment came for Greg Allen when Sabrina Allen and her mother were spotted in Mexico City, on June 13, 2003.</p>  <p>But they eluded authorities.</p>  <p>It would take 11 more years before authorities finally caught up to Sabrina Allen and her mother.</p>  <p>What now remains to be seen is how much of her father Sabrina Allen remembers -- and how much of his great hunt for her she'll come to fathom.</p> "
"173","What to know about Mexico City","CNN.com","2014-08-28 14:45:24","2014-10-06 05:46:23","http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/01/travel/mexico-city-things-to-know/index.html","Travel"," <p>With more than 20 million people pulsing through its streets, it's one of the world's largest cities.</p>  <p>That big-city bustle brings with it delicious food, massive markets and more cultural events in a day than anyone can ever keep track of.</p>  <p>There's lavish wealth, devastating poverty and a lot to discover in Mexico's sprawling capital:</p>  <p>1 . Looking to set a quirky record? Mexico City might be the world's best place to do it.</p>  <p>One big perk of having so many people in the same place: It's easy to set a record if you can persuade enough of them to do the same thing at the same time.</p>  <p>Records for the most people kissing simultaneously (39,879), the most people dancing to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" at the same time (13,597) and the world's biggest enchilada (weighing nearly 1.5 tons) have all been set inside the Mexican capital, according to Guinness World Records.</p>  <p>2. Gays and lesbians are welcome .</p>  <p>For years, Latin America's deep-rooted ties to the Roman Catholic Church meant much of the region tended to take a more conservative tack when it came to homosexuality. But that's started to shift in recent years, and Mexico City has been at the forefront.</p>  <p>Same-sex marriage is legal there . So is adoption by same-sex couples. And the city has marketed itself as a destination for gay tourists. In 2010, the city offered a free honeymoon to Latin America's first gay couple to wed .</p>  <p>3. You might have heard about the smog. They're working on i t .</p>  <p>Pollution in Mexico City used to be so bad that children painting pictures of the sky reportedly would color it gray, not blue .</p>  <p>Because of its geographic location -- in a valley between mountains -- and the sheer number of cars traveling its streets, smog is a problem the city is still battling. But with government programs that encourage bike-riding and limit the number of days motorists can take to the streets, longtime residents say the pollution problem is much better than it used to be.</p>  <p>Another innovative solution debuted last year: a hospital tower covered with a facade designed to ""eat smog,"" breaking down pollutants when the sun hits it. Designers say the tiles on the facade of the Manuel Gea Gonzalez Hospital neutralize the effects of 1,000 cars every day.</p>  <p>4. The city was built on a lake.</p>  <p>It's hard to imagine now, but much of the sprawling concrete jungle that now makes up Mexico City was once a large lake.</p>  <p>The Aztecs constructed a massive civilization there, with Tenochtitlan serving as the capital.</p>  <p>That city, which started out on an island and expanded to include reclaimed parts of the lake, thrived until the Spanish conquest. After winning the battle for control of the area in 1521, Spaniards destroyed Tenochtitlan and built Mexico City on top of its ruins, using canals and roads from the Aztec city as the basis for new streets and eventually draining the lake.</p>  <p>But they didn't entirely erase the past. That's made for some fascinating ancient finds as Mexico City grew into a modern urban metropolis.</p>  <p>In 1978, electrical company workers digging near the city's central square came upon an Aztec relic. That led to archaeologists unearthing ruins of the Templo Mayor, an Aztec temple that's now a popular tourist destination in Mexico City.</p>  <p>5 . It's sinking.</p>  <p>It turns out the dried-out bed of a big lake isn't the best foundation for building construction.</p>  <p>If you want proof, take a look at some of Mexico City's most iconic structures.</p>  <p>The sloped floor and a swinging pendulum inside the Metropolitan Cathedral show that the building is decidedly tilted.</p>  <p>Head up Reforma Avenue to the Angel of Independence , and you'll need to walk up steps that the city built over the years as the area around the 1910 monument sank.</p>  <p>Government officials have estimated that the city is sinking at a rate of 10 centimeters (4 inches) per year. A recent government report (PDF) estimated that Mexico City has sunk 10 meters (32.8 feet) in the past 60 years.</p>  <p>6. One of the world's richest men lives here.</p>  <p>Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim topped Forbes Magazine's list of the world's richest men for four years. Microsoft founder Bill Gates reclaimed the No. 1 spot this year . But Slim and his family, with an estimated net worth of $71.4 billion , are still sitting comfortably in second place.</p>  <p>Slim lives in Mexico City, and many of the companies he controls are based there, too. Even if you're just passing through the city, you're bound to come across his holdings.</p>  <p>Talking on a Mexican cell phone? It's pretty likely that it's tied to Slim's company, Telcel, which controls 70% of Mexico's wireless market.</p>  <p>Swinging by a department store? If you spend any time in Mexico City, you'll probably find a reason to stop at Sanborns, Slim's ubiquitous chain that contains restaurants, pharmacies and retail goods.</p>  <p>Admiring beautiful buildings in the city's historic center? Slim helped finance a major facelift there in recent years.</p>  <p>7. It's safer than som e parts of the country.</p>  <p>Many Mexicans used to fear traveling to their nation's capital, concerned about crime.</p>  <p>Street assaults and kidnapping are still major worries for residents and visitors. And in high-end neighborhoods, you might find a store selling bulletproof glass near a designer clothing boutique.</p>  <p>But the city's homicide rate is on par with other major metropolises around the world.</p>  <p>And with drug violence plaguing other parts of the country, Mexico City has actually earned a reputation as one of the safer places to go .</p>  <p>8 . It's not just tacos and tequila.</p>  <p>Don't expect to find much cheesy Tex-Mex fare here. The Mexico City culinary scene is muy caliente, with fancy restaurants in posh hotels and top chefs saying they come here for inspiration .</p>  <p>Pujol, a restaurant in the city's posh Polanco neighborhood, ranks among the world's top eateries . But it's not all about fine dining. Market stalls and street stands serve up some of the city's most delicious food.</p>  <p>If you're looking for tequila, it's not hard to get it. But if you want to drink like a local, try mezcal or pulque.</p>  <p>All three drinks are made from agave plants. Tequila comes from blue agave. Mezcal can be made from different types of agave plants and has become a popular drink for hipsters in Mexico's capital.</p>  <p>So has pulque, a 2,000-year-old Aztec drink made from fermented but undistilled agave juice.</p>  <p>9. The subway is fast, cheap and fascinating.</p>  <p>While many businessmen and foreigners who live in the city rely on taxis and car services, Mexico City's metro is still the most popular way to get around for the masses.</p>  <p>Protests after authorities announced plans to raise fees last year weren't successful. But taking the subway is still pretty cheap: just 5 pesos (about 40 cents) for a ticket.</p>  <p>And it's not just a way to get from point A to point B. For some people, stations on the city's 12 subway lines are a destination. There are shops, libraries, art exhibits and even computer labs inside.</p>  <p>A pedestrian tunnel between two subway stations in the heart of the city boasts more than 40 bookstores .</p>  <p>10. It's not all loud noise and concrete.</p>  <p>If you need a break from the bustle, it takes only a short subway ride in Mexico City to reach places where you'll feel like you stepped back in time.</p>  <p>Neighborhoods like San Angel and Coyoacan (where artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo made their home) have cobblestone streets, beautiful buildings and quaint cafes that will give you a chance to catch your breath.</p> "

"178","Penguins","CNN.com","2013-02-01 21:43:09","2014-10-06 05:50:01","http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/14/travel/penguin-viewing/index.html","Travel"," <p>From the windswept beaches of Tierra del Fuego at South America's tip to sunny Cape Town, South Africa, and Melbourne, Australia, penguin colonies exist in many strikingly beautiful destinations in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>  <p>There's no denying it: Penguins are among the most charismatic creatures. Their notorious curiosity, waddling gait and comical body language seldom fail to charm. But these flightless sea birds have evolved over 15 million years to become strong, nimble swimmers that often migrate long distances in pursuit of fish following seasonal ocean currents.</p>  <p>7 prime spots for wildlife viewing</p>  <p>Today, most of the 18 species of penguins are in decline because of climate change, habitat destruction, pollution and overfishing -- in fact, more than half are considered endangered. You can support their survival by visiting carefully managed colonies where tour operators respect penguin habitat and educate visitors about conservation efforts.</p>  <p>November through March -- when it's the warmest in the Southern Hemisphere -- is prime time for viewing many penguin species. During the warm season, they spend more time on shore to breed, nest and raise their young.</p>  <p>Check out these amazing penguin spots:</p>  <p>Tierra del Fuego (Argentina and Chile)</p>  <p>Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world, boasts several tour operators offering day cruises to view penguins and other marine life. But only one, PiraTour, gives visitors the chance to walk among the penguins.</p>  <p>PiraTour runs two six-hour tours daily from the port of Ushuaia. Tours are limited to 20 people, so be sure to make reservations well in advance. A 90-minute minivan ride takes visitors through Patagonian forests and along secluded pebbly coves before arriving at Estancia Harberton, a charming family-owned farm and marine center. From there, visitors transfer to a boat for a short ride to Isla Martillo, a research station that monitors the 3,000 pairs of Magellanic penguins and a small colony of gentoo penguins that nest here between September and April.</p>  <p>Visitors will spend up to an hour observing the very vocal Magellanic penguins, which bellow and strut along the beach by the hundreds. The tour guide will instruct you to maintain a safe distance from the birds, but be prepared for them to approach you as penguins can be extremely curious. After a few minutes on the beach, you'll be led up a bluff to see their nesting ground, where the birds often return to the same mate and same nest year after year.</p>  <p>Back at Estancia Harberton, you'll have time to grab a hot drink at the tea room or explore the farm's on-site marine research center. There is also a guest house and camp sites; contact Harberton directly if you want to extend your visit to this peaceful haven. Otherwise, Ushuaia offers a wide range of accommodation options, from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels perched on glacial mountainsides overlooking the city.</p>  <p>PiraTour , U.S. $95 for a six-hour tour (50% discount for children under 12), plus $13 entry fee to Estancia Harberton</p>  <p>Phillip Island, Australia</p>  <p>Since the 1920s, tourists have flocked to Phillip Island to witness the smallest penguin species, known as little penguins or fairy penguins, return to shore each evening to feed their young after a long day of fishing. Only 12 inches tall and weighing less than 3 pounds, the little penguin is found only in Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>For decades, the penguins on Phillip Island were largely unprotected from the throngs of sightseers, but today most visitors observe the evening penguin ""parade"" from elevated boardwalks and viewing platforms to minimize disturbances to the birds.</p>  <p>For those who want a more up-close-and-personal experience, a limited number of tickets are available each day for small group, ranger-guided tours where you can walk among penguins on a secluded beach. The ticket price helps support conservation work on the island, including habitat restoration and research focusing on how penguins are affected by climate change, development and invasive species.</p>  <p>Phillip Island is a 90-minute drive from Melbourne, but plan on spending at least a couple of days here to enjoy all its wildlife, including koalas, wallabies, elusive anteaters, seals and whales.</p>  <p>Phillip Island Nature Park , prices start at U.S. $23 for evening viewing from a platform, $46 for close-up viewing and $82.50 for a private, ranger-guided ecoadventure in a part of the penguin colony that's closed to the general public.</p>  <p>Cape Town, South Africa</p>  <p>The southern tip of Africa offers numerous opportunities to view the African penguin, previously known as the jackass penguin because of its distinctive donkey-like bray.</p>  <p>African penguins have declined by 80% in the past 50 years because of pollution, development, climate change and irresponsible tourism activities. The Boulders Beach colony, about 24 miles from Cape Town, was only established in 1983, but it's now an important habitat for the endangered bird.</p>  <p>As its name suggests, the beach is strewn with granite boulders, which create an impressive backdrop for photographing the penguins. Today, boardwalk viewing areas help protect the birds from excessive human contact, although you may encounter penguins while swimming and should take care not to approach them if possible.</p>  <p>A ride on the wild side in Tanzania</p>  <p>Boulders Beach is part of Table Mountain National Park, situated at the convergence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans on the Cape of Good Hope. Hiking, mountain biking, wind sailing and wildlife viewing are just a few of the activities here that offer impressive views of Cape Town and the surrounding countryside. The nearby village of Simon's Town, with its historic cottages and cobblestone streets, provides numerous accommodation and dining options.</p>  <p>Table Mountain National Park , visitors to the park pay a daily conservation fee of U.S. $5.30 per adult and $2.50 per child.</p>  <p>Otago Peninsula, New Zealand</p>  <p>Even in a country known for its dramatic scenery and amazing wildlife, the Otago Peninsula stands out. Located on New Zealand's South Island, the peninsula was born of volcanic eruptions that created steep mountains and rugged sea cliffs. It's a hot spot for marine wildlife viewing -- seals, sea lions, elephant seals and, of course, penguins. Here it's possible to see both the little penguin and the rare yellow-eyed penguin.</p>  <p>A number of tour operators on the peninsula are committed to environmental education and sustainable ecotourism. Nature Guides Otago offers naturalist-led tours as well as lodging that emphasize sustainability and support penguin habitat restoration and conservation.</p>  <p>Another option is Penguin Place, a conservation reserve on a private farm. Visitors begin the tour by learning about penguin conservation efforts before proceeding to a series of trenches and observation huts. From these vantage points, they are treated to up-close views of a yellow-eyed penguin colony while minimizing disturbances to the birds, which live in coastal forests and have suffered significant habitat loss from logging.</p>  <p>Nature Guides Otago , a sunrise tour of a yellow-eyed penguin colony, maximum six people, runs U.S. $75 per person. Nature packages, which include two nights at a B&B cottage, sunrise penguin tour and a daylong tour of the Otago Peninsula, run $540 per person. Note that tour priority is given to those staying at the cottage.</p>  <p>Penguin Place , penguin tours run throughout the day. Price is U.S. $41 for adults and $10 for children. Budget accommodations are available at the Penguin Place Lodge for U.S. $22 adults, $8.50 children</p>  <p>Galapagos Islands, Ecuador</p>  <p>It comes as a surprise to most travelers that a trip to the Galapagos could include the chance to see penguins. But in fact, the islands are home to the only penguin that lives in a tropical climate. Unlike other species that migrate according to the season, endangered Galapagos penguins live here year-round, especially in the colder waters of the western islands such as Isla Isabela.</p>  <p>Almost any tour of the Galapagos includes the chance to see an incredible variety of wildlife, but some operators specifically offer penguin tours. More likely than not you'll be observing the birds from a boat, but if the tour includes snorkeling in an area frequented by penguins, there's a chance that you could end up swimming with the birds.</p>  <p>Southern Exploration, a member of the International Ecotourism Society, is one tour operator that offers the chance to see penguins at close range. However, since the Galapagos National Park Service restricts tourists to specific areas and may limit access depending on conditions, it's best to contact tour operators directly to confirm that you'll be able to see penguins on your trip. Talk through the options carefully with the booking agent to make sure your expectations will be met.</p>  <p>Southern Explorations , four to 15-day Galapagos cruising tours with an English-speaking guide, start at around U.S. $3,000 up to about $6,000, including the flight from Quito to the Galapagos. Ask to speak to a Galapagos expert and tell them you are interested in seeing penguins so they can find an appropriate tour during your travel dates. Avoid holiday travel unless you book a year or more in advance -- tours around Christmas and Easter fill up fast.</p> "

They're used to feeding and drinking (in certain areas), and those features are still there in the mind of an elephant,"" explains Alex Chunga, a manager at Kusungu National Park.</p>  <p>""When an animal goes back to where it used to go, and suddenly there are people, those people feel the animal is doing something wrong, but in essence, it used to be their home.""</p>  <p>Each year, thousands of wild animals fall victim to human encroachment, poaching and the illegal pet trade. The Lilongwe Wildlife Center -- the country's only accredited wildlife sanctuary -- is hoping to change that. They house over 200 animals and host educational tours for school children to get them into conservation early.</p>  <p>Cast of characters</p>  <p>Every animal as the Lilongwe Wildlife Center has a story, and often, not a happy one. Take for instance Stumpy, a one-armed baboon who was found tied to a tree outside a butcher shop. Because he likely wouldn't survive back in the wild, the Center will be his home for the remainder of his life.</p>  <p>Then there are the seven owls (each since named after one of Snow White's dwarfs) who a local found on his roof and, fearing they were bad luck, almost killed them before someone convinced him to call them in instead.</p>  <p>There's also Xena, a vervet monkey who was kept as a pet and tied to a rope on the roof of a barn. As a result, she's never interacted with other monkeys, and has to be trained to coexist with her own kind.</p>  <p>""This is a good site for animals who are not getting the proper welfare,"" says Yessiah Symon, Lilongwe's head of animal care.</p>  <p>Do they stay or do they go?</p>  <p>Lilongwe is partnered with Kasungu National Park, 111 miles outside of the reserve, to release some animals back into the wild. To qualify for release, an animal needs to have spent part of its life in the wild, or be young enough to adapt. It also has to be in good health.</p>  <p>A lot goes into training animals to reintegrate into the world at large. For starters, there is a strict no-human contact policy. The subjects are also given predator awareness training. Once reintroduced into the park, some animals are then monitored by release managers to make sure they're integrating properly.</p>  <p>Conservation for the future</p>  <p>To further the cause, Lilongwe hosts thousands of school children each year. Last year alone, they received over 30,000 school groups. They teach the children respect for wildlife, and try and drive home the point that some animals -- like primates -- aren't meant to be pets.</p>  <p>""We've managed to come up with various modules, from targeting biodiversity, soil management, climate change, and wildlife welfare,"" explains Clement Manjaalera, Lilongwe's education manager.</p>  <p>""Inspiring youth to conserve nature, to look after animals and have respect towards these animals and also to take a leading role in these projects is important. It can be useful in helping them to have a sustainable livelihood.""</p>  <p>Read: Wildlife 101: Eco schools take over Africa</p>  <p>Read: Last chance to save Africa's rhinos?</p> "
"184","11 things to know about Quebec","CNN.com","2014-09-22 13:22:47","2014-10-06 05:53:00","http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/01/travel/quebec-11-things/index.html","Travel"," <p>Who are the language police, and what do they really do?</p>  <p>Inhabitants of Quebec, Canada's largest French-speaking province, pride themselves on being different from their neighbors, and that sentiment extends from the language they speak to the food on their plates, and beyond. If there's anything that unites all Quebecers, it's their joie de vivre: Quebec is a place where fun is taken seriously.</p>  <p>Consider these truths for a better understanding of the province:</p>  <p>1. This is F rench soil, with a language police</p>  <p>This tiny francophone enclave has some of the strictest language laws in the world.</p>  <p>French must be the predominant language on signs, retail or food service employees always greet customers in French, and there are even laws dictating whether parents can send their children to English or French school.</p>  <p>O Canada! Our home and delicious land</p>  <p>About 80% of the province's nearly 8 million inhabitants have French as a mother tongue, and outside of multicultural metropolis Montreal, most people only speak French.</p>  <p>Time.com: Quebec's war on English</p>  <p>There's an entity called the OQLF (Office quebecois de la langue francaise), otherwise known as the language police. They enforce the rules by doling out fines to noncompliant businesses, and are usually plain clothed and covert. Recently, language tensions have risen among locals, and OQLF overzealousness was the main culprit.</p>  <p>2. There are Catholic churches for sale</p>  <p>Given that Quebec's most popular curse words (""tabarnak"" and ""ostie"") are derived from church terms, it's not surprising the Catholic church once played a big role here, but today many of the parishes are empty and have fallen into disrepair.</p>  <p>Many of the buildings are for sale, and buyers have been difficult to come by. Some are being demolished, while others have been converted for non-religious purposes.</p>  <p>Montreal band Arcade Fire recorded their Grammy Award-winning album The Suburbs in a church in rural Farnham, Quebec, but they recently put up their ""Petite église"" (little church) for sale, citing a damaged roof.</p>  <p>3. Quebec has its own national holiday</p>  <p>Canada Day is on July 1, and while Quebecers still get that day off, those celebrations are muted compared to those of St. Jean Baptiste Day -- known as Fête Nationale -- held a week earlier on June 24.</p>  <p>Because it falls right at the start of summer, the festivities are held outdoors. Quebec has a robust francophone music industry, with its own stars, and St. Jean Baptiste Day is the perfect time to check out the folk revival scene live.</p>  <p>There's a strong nationalistic component to the holiday -- especially for the current minority who believe Quebec should be its own country.</p>  <p>Just be sure to wear blue and keep all Maple Leaf-related paraphernalia at home.</p>  <p>4. Quebec loves small town hockey</p>  <p>The Montreal Canadiens are the only Quebec-based team in the NHL, but outside of Montreal, the storied Habs aren't unanimously adored.</p>  <p>The province has its own junior hockey league for players aged 16-20, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, with teams hailing primarily from smaller towns (including a few outside of Quebec). It's the league where NHL Hall of Famers Mario Lemieux and Patrick Roy cut their teeth.</p>  <p>There's also the rock 'em sock 'em minor-pro North American Hockey League, more famous for fights than goals.</p>  <p>While Quebecers don't participate in hockey en masse the way they used to, it's still the most popular sport there, and in the winter, towns will erect their own free, outdoor rinks.</p>  <p>5. Many Quebecers speak joual</p>  <p>The language of Molière has evolved considerably in the former French colony.</p>  <p>Each region has its own linguistic quirks (they're not all called joual, but the term has become a catch-all), and visitors from other French speaking places are often taken aback by the unique contractions and ""anglicisms"" that have crept into the daily vernacular.</p>  <p>The most creative and colorful joual from the Montreal region usually entails combining multiple words into one, lopping off extraneous syllables or casually dropping English terms with French pronunciation. For instance, most people simply say ""weekend"" instead of ""fin de semaine."" Sentences often end with ""tsé,"" which means ""tu sais,"" or ""you know""?</p>  <p>Joual is considered a working-class dialect, so while it's celebrated for being homegrown, people of a certain stature aspire to speak a more refined French.</p>  <p>6. Montreal and Quebec City have their own haute cuisine scenes</p>  <p>With almost no outside interference, Montreal has forged its own strange culinary identity, bringing formal French education and homegrown ingredients to rich, meat-heavy Quebec staples.</p>  <p>Expect a lot of foie gras (duck liver), Princess scallops, Matane shrimp, organic vegetables, cheese and high-quality pork. For those interested in game, venison and caribou appear on some menus.</p>  <p>In Quebec City, where the cooking scene is more youthful, there's a fierce commitment to using only made-in-Quebec ingredients.</p>  <p>Quebec is by far the world's largest producer of maple syrup, and during the spring thaw in March, sugar shacks (cabanes à sucre) offer the tasty treat, poured over snow or with a full meal of pancakes, beans, pork and more.</p>  <p>Because cooking school is subsidized by the provincial government, trained chefs in Quebec tend to come from more diverse backgrounds.</p>  <p>7. Even the poutine is being reinvented</p>  <p>The cat is out of the bag concerning Quebec's slimiest treat. The famous dish -- consisting of fries, sauce brune (gravy) and cheese curds -- is being copied in the rest of Canada, and has even made its way down to New York.</p>  <p>In Montreal specifically, some chefs have expanded upon the traditional poutine by adding fancier toppings like foie gras and duck confit.</p>  <p>The greasy spoon (or casse-croûte) favorite is no longer just for famished drunks.</p>  <p>A few towns in Quebec claim to have invented poutine, but the loudest and proudest of those is Drummondville, an hour east of Montreal.</p>  <p>8. Quebec's biggest party is also when it's coldest</p>  <p>Carnaval du Quebec is held every February in Quebec City, the provincial capital, and the success and sheer size of the event is a testament to Quebecers' defiance toward the cold.</p>  <p>There are myriad outdoor activities to partake in over the two-week-long, tourist-friendly festival, but the biggest draws are the massive, illuminated ice palace and the ice sculpture contest.</p>  <p>The ice palace is meant to be the home of Bonhomme, the festival's smiling mascot. The big guy's reach extends far beyond Carnaval though: he's one of Quebec's most recognizable faces.</p>  <p>9. Bear the cold: Quebec's best activities are done outdoors</p>  <p>Ice fishing and snowshoeing -- two activities that were long ago done for necessity -- have evolved into beloved pastimes.</p>  <p>Wherever there's a frozen lake in Quebec, expect to see a handful of temporary huts over it. Renting the necessary gear during the season -- which goes from December to February -- is a painless process.</p>  <p>Snowshoe technology has modernized dramatically. Snowshoes don't look like oversized tennis rackets anymore: they're made with lightweight synthetic materials, and there are different types, depending on whether you're walking in the deep snow for leisure or sport.</p>  <p>In the summer, there's the Route Verte: a network of bicycle paths that stretches across the province from West to East.</p>  <p>10. Expo 67 modernized Montreal, and there are still remnants of it</p>  <p>Montrealers can be shameless braggarts when it comes to civic pride, and the World's Fair the city hosted in 1967, known simply as Expo 67, is considered by many natives to be a high-water mark for the city.</p>  <p>Much of the infrastructure built for the Fair remains. The city's underground public transportation system, the Metro, opened a year before the Expo, and the dirt that was excavated was used to create the artificial island Île Notre-Dame, which is where the Formula One racetrack and casino (formerly the French Pavilion) are located.</p>  <p>There's also Habitat 67, a gravity defying housing development originally conceptualized using Lego pieces (and it shows), and the Biosphere, a geodesic dome that was originally the American Pavilion.</p>  <p>Another international Pavilion that survived the test of time? Jamaica's -- it's used for private events now.</p>  <p>11. The roads are in bad shape</p>  <p>Blame the weather, the materials used or government ineptitude, but Quebec roads don't seem to hold up as well as those of their American or Ontarian neighbors.</p>  <p>In addition to mammoth potholes and cracks, road surface markings seem to fade quickly. Road conditions are especially bad during spring, when the snow melts and temperatures rise.</p>  <p>And that's to say nothing of Montreal's crumbling interchanges and overpasses, which probably look worse than they really are.</p>  <p>Be prepared to be redirected a fair bit during the summer, because that's when most construction work is done.</p> "

It's Western Europe's second-largest country (after France) in terms of area, and the world's third-largest exporter of wine, fruits and vegetables .</p>  <p>But it's the incredible diversity of its people and passions that holds the key to understanding Spain's eternal appeal.</p>  <p>More on CNN: ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" season two</p>  <p>1. There are many Spains</p>  <p>During the grim decades of the fascist Francisco Franco's rule, regional languages such as Basque, Catalan and Galician were banned in Spain.</p>  <p>On the dictator's death in 1975, a new, ultra-liberal constitution broke up Castilian centralism by handing over sweeping autonomy to the 17 regions.</p>  <p>The result was a reinvigorated sense of regional pride that had a ripple effect on every form of culture.</p>  <p>That's why street signs and menus sometimes come in unfamiliar dialects and languages such as Gallego (Galicia), which closely resembles Portuguese; Bable (Asturias); Catalan in Catalonia, the Balearics and Valencia; and Basque (possibly Europe's oldest language), which remains an unfathomable mystery of x's, k's and z's.</p>  <p>2. Bulls are a unifying forc e</p>  <p>Despite the diversity, Spain has at least one common thread: bulls.</p>  <p>The bull is Spain's iconic animal, and you won't miss seeing at least one -- alive, dead or fake.</p>  <p>They famously thunder through the streets of Pamplona each July and snort and kick round the bull rings of Madrid, Seville and countless smaller towns.</p>  <p>They also appear on hilltops beside motorways and in a decades-old advertisement for Osborne sherry .</p>  <p>Many a stuffed bull's head watches over a bar interior, where aficionados might be glued to a televised bullfight and later scan a review of the fight in the arts, not sports, section of the newspaper.</p>  <p>There are areas of resistance to what some see as a barbaric event.</p>  <p>The popularity of the bloody contest is waning among the younger generation, and Catalonia has now banned the sport completely.</p>  <p>3. Spaniards don't eat when you normally d o</p>  <p>Lunch is from 2 p.m. onward, and dinner comes after 10 p.m.</p>  <p>If you're hungry in between or can't reset your body clock, there's help -- tapas and pintxo bars (pintxo is the Basque equivalent of tapas) open around midday and again around 7 p.m.</p>  <p>In some bars, a snack still comes free with a glass of beer, sherry or wine, but some places now charge.</p>  <p>San Sebastian is Spain's gourmet capital, not only for top restaurants but also pintxo bars.</p>  <p>You can make a meal on exquisite miniature dishes and glasses of txakoli (a lightly sparkling dry white wine), Rioja or cider.</p>  <p>4. There's coastline beyond the Costa del Sol</p>  <p>On the Costa del Sol, tales of rampant overpricing and badly designed hotels conflict with the glam, moneyed image of Marbella .</p>  <p>The eastern Mediterranean coast is better known for low-cost tourism.</p>  <p>But there are still unspoiled beaches where development and commercialism are largely absent.</p>  <p>One of Spain's rare volcanic regions, Cabo de Gata is a protected area in the southeast, where black-sand beaches sit beneath Arab watchtowers, monumental rocks and cactus-studded hills.</p>  <p>In the southwest, the sandy beaches south of Cadiz are superb for windsurfing.</p>  <p>In the north, attractive coves and fishing harbors edge the Bay of Biscay .</p>  <p>5.

Life i s just a series of fiestas</p>  <p>Frenetic music, food, booze, dance and dressing up make saints' festivals a highlight of the year in Spain, even in the tiniest of villages.</p>  <p>The quirky Spanish imagination -- Pedro Almodovar's movies exemplify it, as do Salvador Dalí's paintings -- gives birth to the parade of grotesque papier mache figures in Valencia's Las Fallas festival and the giant annual tomato fight in the town of Bunol.</p>  <p>Seekers of peace and quiet might want to avoid Hellin , in Castile-La Mancha, when 10,000 drummers play for several days.</p>  <p>Those of a nervous disposition might steer clear of Ribarteme , in Galicia, when survivors of near-death experiences parade through the tiny village in open-top coffins.</p>  <p>When wild horses are corralled in Sabucedo , wine flows all night during La Rioja's grape harvest or flamenco singers carouse into the early hours during Seville's Feria de Abril , you know you can only be in Spain.</p>  <p>7.

Easter is more important than Christma s</p>  <p>Easter week (Semana Santa) is easily more important than Christmas in Spain.</p>  <p>The whole country shuts down for four days from Holy Thursday at 1 p.m., a rare example of punctuality.</p>  <p>Day and night, swaying processions of impassioned penitents in tall hoods and flowing robes advance to a hypnotic drumbeat, carrying crucifixes and weighty life-size statues of agonizing Christ figures and weeping virgins on pasos (floats), while flickering torchlight adds to the electric atmosphere.</p>  <p>Andalucian pageants are more animated, with stirring saetas -- spontaneous wails of passion.</p>  <p>In the north, although the pattern of parish brotherhoods is similar, the atmosphere is more solemn.</p>  <p>9.

We bet you've also stood awestruck before the Hagia Sofia and the Taj Majal.</p>  <p>You're a regular Tony Wheeler, who co-founded Lonely Planet travel company more than 40 years ago. Like you, he's visited most of the world's major wonders and almost everything else worth seeing.</p>  <p>Wheeler and fellow world explorer Vince Michael, head of the Global Heritage Fund , are always looking for hidden places to discover. By all means, they say, visit Angkor Wat and the Hagia Sophia. Go there and check them off your bucket list.</p>  <p>But don't you want to explore places everyone hasn't already seen? That's why CNN asked Michael and Wheeler, a Global Heritage Fund board member, to pick some hidden gems to explore. These are spots where we hope you won't always share your trip with thousands of other travelers.</p>  <p>""Who hasn't seen pictures and read about Angkor Wat in Cambodia?"" Wheeler told CNN. ""But Banteay Chhmar? It's an unknown, and discovering an unknown is always a delight.</p>  <p>""Ditto for the Taj Mahal in India. Nobody's disappointed when they see the Taj for the first time, but they've seen pictures of it. It's popped up in TV programs and movies so often, that actually seeing it is no surprise. Hampi, however, is going to be totally unexpected.""</p>  <p>Let the crowds swarm the world's best-known marvels. The lesser-known Global Heritage Fund sites below can be found in the same countries -- without the crowds. And two spots are still on Wheeler's bucket list.</p>  <p>That's right: Even the co-founder of Lonely Planet hasn't yet been to these picks in India and Peru. Maybe you can beat him there.</p>  <p>Some of the more undiscovered spots require long and bumpy bus rides through the mountains, while others are located near luxury hotels. No matter which you choose, they will knock your (hiking) boots off.</p>  <p>Pingyao Ancient City, China</p>  <p>Called the ""Long Wall of Ten Thousand Li"" in China, the more than 20,000-kilometer Great Wall was built from the third century B.C. to the 17th century A.D. on China's northern border and is the world's largest military structure.</p>  <p>Prefer to see a more complete picture of ancient Chinese life? Book a high-speed rail train ticket and take the 700-kilometer (435-mile) journey southwest from Beijing to Pingyao in just four hours. (The regular train trip can take anywhere from 10 to 14 hours.)</p>  <p>Pingyao Ancient City is a stunning Han Chinese city from the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). Nearly 400 of the 4,000 existing Ming- and Qing-era courtyard buildings are still intact, as is a 6-kilometer city wall. The city was a center for China's banking industry in the 19th and 20th centuries, and some of the imposing buildings are evidence of the city's wealth.</p>  <p>"" Pingyao is such a magical place given the incredible urbanization in Beijing and Shanghai and the fact that every other Chinese city has lost its wall,"" says Michael. ""You really feel like you have stepped into the past.""</p>  <p>7 fascinating cities of destruction</p>  <p>Chavin de Huantar, Peru</p>  <p>Many visitors to Peru fly into Lima and hop on a quick flight to Cuzco to explore the 15th century Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu , perhaps the most stunning structure standing from the Inca empire.</p>  <p>How about a site a few centuries older? One of the oldest cultures in Peru, Chavin de Huantar was a pan-Andean culture that thrived in the location of the same name between 1500 B.C. and 400 B.C. some 3,180 meters above sea level.</p>  <p>The Chavin archaeological site , located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Lima, seems to have been a religious and ceremonial pilgrimage center for the pre-Columbian Andean religious world.</p>  <p>""It is distinguished by a highly organized platform-mound-and-plaza architecture that includes precocious use of finely cut and worked stone facades as well as an intricate, graphic, baroque and instantly recognizable 'art' style executed in stone, pottery, bone, shell and gold,"" says Michael. ""It also represents one of the earliest manifestations of Shamanism, where power was legitimized through a belief in the small elite having a divine connection.""</p>  <p>""The monumental center of Chavin itself was clearly a very significant place, and its elaborate architecture places it among the most impressive temples of its time, anywhere in the world.""</p>  <p>Take an eight-hour bus ride from Lima to the northern town of Huaraz, and it's another bumpy three-to-four hour bus ride from Huaraz to Chavin.</p>  <p>Catalhoyuk, Turkey</p>  <p>Part of Istanbul's distinct skyline, the Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom) cathedral currently standing opened in the 6th century A.D. and is where rulers of the East Roman Empire were crowned.</p>  <p>We prefer to explore Catalhoyuk , a 700-kilometer drive south from Istanbul, where lovers of ancient civilizations can find one of the earliest known towns in the world.</p>  <p>Catalhoyuk is a nearly 10,000-year-old example of a well-preserved Neolithic town, showing how humans moved into sedentary life, organized themselves and developed a culture. It contains some of the world's earliest known mural art and is considered central to the origin of civilization in the Middle East.</p>  <p>It's an ancient agricultural community rather than a big site of temples, palaces and streets lined with columns, ""plus hardly any visitors,"" says Wheeler. ""Unlike the better known Greek and Roman sites of Turkey, this place is a bit of a mystery.""</p>  <p>While the houses have evidence of lovely art and sculpture, the homes themselves are made of unfired mud brick and present a challenge for conservationists.</p>  <p>UNESCO's newest World Heritage Sites</p>  <p>Hampi, India</p>  <p>One of the most well-known and admired structures and examples of Indo-Islamic architecture in the world, the Taj Mahal is a marble mausoleum built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor in memory of a beloved wife.</p>  <p>A site of equal interest lies in the south of India at Hampi , the last capital of the last Hindu Kingdom of Vijayanagar. A six-hour drive from Goa or Bangalore, Hampi was conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565 and plundered before it was abandoned.</p>  <p>Still standing are several temples, including the Krishna temple complex, the Chandramauleshwar Temple and the temples of Ramachandra and Hazara Rama. There are also hundreds of other remains on the site, including stables, water structures, shrines and royal complexes.</p>  <p>""Hampi is a stunning complex of magnificent temples and other structures set along a dramatic riverine site,"" says Michael, calling it ""a dramatic testament to one of the earth's oldest civilizations.""</p>  <p>Banteay Chhmar, Cambodia</p>  <p>The temple of Angkor Wat is the best-known site at Cambodia's Angkor archaeological site, which also has the remains of several different capitals of the Khmer Empire from the 9th to the 15th centuries.</p>  <p>Lesser known but rich in archaeological ruins, the temple complex of Banteay Chhmar (the Citadel of the Cats) in the northeast corner of Cambodia was commissioned by Khmer King Jayavarman VII (1181 A.D. -1219 A.D.).</p>  <p>A three-hour drive from Angkor Wat, it's well-known for bas reliefs documenting the period's history. Looters got to many bas reliefs and other art in the 1990s, and the Global Heritage Fund wants to preserve the remaining art and the central temple complex and aid the local community in developing tourism.</p>  <p>This is really ""a 'wow' site,"" says Wheeler. It has ""all the attractions from huge stone faces to intricately carved bas reliefs that you find at the crowded Angkor sites and no crowds at all.""</p>  <p>Think libraries are dying?

A natural bridge is a type of arch, where water is the natural force making the hole.</p>  <p>Erosion created these magnificent structures, and erosion will eventually take them down. One such wonder was Aruba's Natural Bridge, which was first formed by pounding surf eroding its coral limestone. The 100-foot-span gave way and collapsed in 2005. (The smaller Baby Bridge is still standing nearby.)</p>  <p>Here are 15 spectacular natural bridges around the world.</p>  <p>America's crazy rock formations</p>  <p>Green Bridge of Wales, United Kingdom</p>  <p>One of the most famous spots in Wales , the Green Bridge of Wales and the rocky Pembrokeshire coastline, are part of a national park. Nearby you can also spot the Stack Rocks, known as the Elegug Stacks in Welsh.</p>  <p>Eventually it's expected that the ocean will wear away the Green Bridge and the middle will collapse, turning it into stacks. Visitors who continue along the coast to see Pen-y-Holt Stack should note that it's in a British Army range and must be visited through walks organized by the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority.</p>  <p>Ayres Natural Bridge, Wyoming</p>  <p>Not all the glory of Wyoming is found at its two internationally famous Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in the northwestern part of the state.</p>  <p>Less well-known but worth the visit is the majestic Ayres Natural Bridge in eastern Wyoming, about 40 miles east of Casper. The 50-foot tall, 100-foot-long natural bridge over LaPrele Creek is the star of this 22-acre park.</p>  <p>Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah</p>  <p>As streams cut into the canyon walls and flash floods further weakened them, the three mighty bridges at Natural Bridges National Monument in the southeastern corner of Utah were carved over millions of years.</p>  <p>The area was declared a national monument in 1908, and the three bridges were given the Hopi names ""Owachomo,"" ""Kachina"" and ""Sipapu"" in 1909. Further erosion has made the once thick and mighty Owachomo Bridge more delicate. While still massive and strong, Kachina Bridge did lose 4,000 tons of rock in 1992.</p>  <p>Pont d'Arc, France</p>  <p>A natural bridge formed by the Ardeche River in the south of France , the Pont d'Arc has a world-famous neighbor: the Chauvet cave paintings, the world's oldest known such works, which date back 36,000 years.</p>  <p>Top 25 amusement parks around the world</p>  <p>Discovered in 1994, the site was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site this year. But the region's natural beauty is also a national treasure. Classified as a French national heritage site in 1982, the 54-meter-long (177-foot-long) natural arch is the only French example of a natural bridge spanning a still-flowing river. It's also a gateway to the river canyon.</p>  <p>Natural Bridges State Beach, California</p>  <p>A famous natural bridge anchors this Santa Cruz beach , which is best known for its tide pools -- go exploring at low tide -- and seasonal monarch butterfly residents. Up to 100,000 monarchs typically move into the state beach's Monarch Grove in mid-October, and they depart the following January or February. There's a party in October to welcome them, and seasonal tours are available.</p>  <p>London Bridge, Australia</p>  <p>Australia's Port Campbell National Park is best known for the Twelve Apostles, towering limestone rock stacks carved by the Southern Ocean. The ocean is still working on the rock, with seven of eight formations still standing.</p>  <p>But there's another gem in this park about 275 kilometers west of Melbourne: London Bridge, a natural offshore rock span that partially collapsed in 1990 and became a bridge without a connection. ( People standing on the rocks were stranded when the middle collapsed and had to be rescued via helicopter.) It's a good idea to stay on the accessible walking paths and scenic drives along the coast.</p>  <p>Spectacular waterfalls around the U.S.</p>  <p>Fairy Bridge, China</p>  <p>China has quite a collection of natural bridges, including one that experts say has the longest span of any natural bridge in the world. The Fairy Bridge (Xianren Qiao), in southwestern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region near the border with Vietnam, has a 400-foot span.</p>  <p>Not that the bridge made of limestone karst is easy to measure. Members of the Natural Arch and Bridge Society took a boat to the site in 2010 and used laser equipment to measure the span, calling it the ""longest known natural arch in the world, by a wide margin.""</p>  <p>Pravcicka Brana, Czech Republic</p>  <p>Hans Christian Andersen wrote part of ""The Snow Queen"" in Bohemian Switzerland, and several scenes from the Chronicles of Narnia were shot here. It's no wonder: The fairytale landscape of this region, now part of the Czech Republic, is magical. Go see its most well-known symbol: the Pravcicka Brana , a natural bridge standing tall in Bohemian Switzerland National Park , now part of the Czech Republic.</p>  <p>While there are many rock formations rising up amid the forests and valleys in the park, Pravcicka Brana is the largest stone bridge on the European continent, with a span of 27 meters (nearly 90 feet) and a height of 21 meters (nearly 70 feet).</p>  <p>Wadi Rum, Jordan</p>  <p>Bedouin tribes still live in goat-hair tents in the Wadi Rum Protected Area of southern Jordan, which is 720 square kilometers (about 278 square miles) of mostly desert wilderness. Among the sandstone and granite mountains and valleys are natural bridges rising up to greet you.</p>  <p>Although visitors can take private cars or hike on foot to explore the bridges and the region, Bedouin cooperatives offer tours via basic Jeep or pickup trucks. And if you want a real adventure, book a camel ride to explore the area and overnight in a Bedouin camp.</p>  <p>Cliffside beaches around the world</p>  <p>Natural Bridge at Yoho National Par k , Canada</p>  <p>While many nature loving explorers head to Canada's famous Banff National Park, there are tall peaks, amazing waterfalls and a spectacular natural bridge to be found to the west at Yoho National Park .</p>  <p>Located on the western slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, Yoho definitely lives up to its name (a Cree expression of awe and wonder). Travelers can witness Kicking Horse River still carving its path through this natural bridge.</p>  <p>Tassili n'Ajjer, Algeria</p>  <p>It's true that southeastern Algeria's Tassili n'Ajjer , named a World Heritage Site in 1982, is better known for more than 15,000 drawings and engravings dating back to 6,000 B.C. The drawings record climate change and human life in the region.</p>  <p>But tucked away in this tense region at the edge of the Sahara, near the border with Libya, Mali and Niger, this spot was also recognized as a UNESCO site for its remarkable collection of natural bridges and rock formations dense enough to be called ""rock forests.""</p>  <p>The eroding sandstone ""forests of rock"" document the environmental changes, marking major climate change and geological transformation over the millennia. Water and wind have shaped this magical, lunar-like landscape.</p>  <p>Natural Bridge, Virginia</p>  <p>Long considered sacred by the Monacans, Virginia's Natural Bridge was one of this English colony's earliest recognized natural wonders. The bridge was created by an underground stream flowing through a cave, whose roof collapsed, according to the arch society.</p>  <p>It even had a famous owner: Thomas Jefferson bought the surrounding land and bridge from King George III of England in 1774, before the young republic's founding.</p>  <p>A National Historic Landmark, the land in Rockbridge County remained in the hands of private owners for centuries. Now the state of Virginia has announced plans to turn the land into a park by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>Cueva de los Portales, Cuba</p>  <p>In the western Cuban province of Pinar del Rio lies the Cueva de los Portales , a cavernous area near the Parque Nacional La Guira. The Río Caiguanabo flows beneath a natural bridge, which is connected to a cave that served as one of revolutionary leader Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara's hideouts during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The area is now popular with birdwatchers.</p>  <p>Hazarchishma Natural Bridge, Afghanistan</p>  <p>When Wildlife Conservation Society researchers traveled to Afghanistan in 2010 to conduct a wildlife survey in the troubled country, they discovered an enormous natural bridge that may be one of the largest in the world. They returned to Hazarchishma Natural Bridge , in the central highlands of Afghanistan, in 2011 to take measurements.</p>  <p>The bridge, which is named after a local village, is more than 60 feet high, has a span of more than 200 feet across its base and rises more than 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) above sea level. It was created over the millennia by the then-flowing waters of the dry Jawzari Canyon.</p>  <p>Lexington Arch, Nevada</p>  <p>Is it a natural bridge? A cornerstone of Great Basin National Park in Nevada, the Lexington Arch may actually be a bridge. There's evidence to suggest that the waters of Lexington Creek flowed through a cave in the canyon wall long ago, expanding the tunnel that's now Lexington Arch. Debate the question as you marvel at one of the few natural arches in the west made of limestone rather than sandstone.</p> "

Like Spotted Lake in Canada, which is considered one of the most bizarre natural wonders in the world, transmogrifying from an average-looking alpine lake into a field of gigantic green polka dots every summer.</p>  <p>There are more than 3 million or so lakes worldwide, so it takes quite an astounding trick to stand out. Some that caught our attention: a lake made of one of the purest skincare ingredients on earth and another with six-foot waves ideal for freshwater surfing.</p>  <p>Nature can also cook up some pretty forbidding lakeside scenes. At Tanzania's Lake Natron, where the water reaches 140 degrees, petrified bats and birds (even doves) have been found washed ashore.</p>  <p>For most travelers, of course, a lake vacation brings to mind more soothing, nostalgia-laden images. It's as classic an American experience as a summer road trip. So by all means, go visit any number of the beautiful lakes in our country's great outdoors. But if you're looking for a one-of-a-kind, see-it-to-believe-it experience, we recommend a detour to one of these peculiar pools instead.</p>  <p>Jellyfish Lake, Palau</p>  <p>By the ocean, jellyfish are a nuisance to swimmers, but taking a dip with them in Palau's Jellyfish Lake is an unexpected pleasure. These golden jellyfish are glowing orbs of pink and purple that range in size from a penny to a soccer ball and were cut off from their natural predators millennia ago. With no need to defend themselves, they evolved without the ability to sting—the only such known species of jellyfish. These blissful creatures do nothing more than soak up the sunlight (their main source of nutrition)—oh, and entertain the humans, who have taken to snorkeling in their midst.</p>  <p>Lake Nong Harn, Thailand</p>  <p>The yearly sprouting of thousands upon thousands of red lotus flowers completely transforms the surface of Lake Nong Harn into an 8,000-acre vision of buoyant blossoms. This aquatic garden begins to grow in October, just after the rainy season. When it reaches full bloom in December, nearby villagers, who trace the origins of the lake to a tragic love myth, take to boats to enjoy the miraculous scenery. The sea of red lotuses—Talay Bua Daeng, as the locals say—is best viewed during daylight hours before noon, when the flowers are fully opened, revealing their vibrant, pink color (not red, despite the name). The lake, which is located in the province of Udon Thani, 350 miles north of Bangkok, stays rosy until March.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: World's longest bridges</p>  <p>La Brea Pitch Lake, Trinidad</p>  <p>Some lakes just stick with you, but none more than this one. Made of about 10 million tons of liquid asphalt and spread over a massive 100 acres, La Brea Pitch Lake is the largest natural deposit of pitch on earth. Its gooey emulsion of water, gas, bitumen, and minerals has been a major source of asphalt throughout the world ever since 1595, when Sir Walter Raleigh happened upon its shores on his quest to find El Dorado. Too bad he wasn't looking for the Fountain of Youth, which is the nickname local villagers had given to the warm, healing pools of sulfur-infused waters that pop up around the lake during rainy season (June to November).</p>  <p>Boiling Lake, Dominica</p>  <p>Water at the center of this 200-foot-wide lakelet stays in a constant rolling boil so hot that no one has been able to take an accurate measurement. But consider that at the shore, this lake already measures between 180 and 197 degrees. Scientists believe the vapor-covered cauldron is really a flooded fumarole, or a vent that leads directly down to volcanic magma. It's not the largest heated lake in the world—that title belongs to the magnificent, comparatively temperate Rotorua lakes in New Zealand—but Boiling Lake is certainly the most forbidding.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: Beautiful beaches</p>  <p>Lake Manicouagan, Canada</p>  <p>Problem: You can't decide if you want to visit a lake or a river. Solution: Lake Manicouagan, in Quebec. Plenty of lakes are round in shape, but this is the only known lake that has been cast into the form of a ring. It was created 200 million years ago when a 3.1-mile-diameter asteroid—the fifth largest ever—crashed into the earth and left behind what appears to be the world's only concentric river. At 1,206 square miles, roughly half the size of Delaware, it's one of the few lakes whose primary island takes up more surface area than actual water, giving you the best of both a lake and a river.</p>  <p>Laguna Colorada, Bolivia</p>  <p>A lake so surreal in color, Salvador Dalí himself might have dreamed it up. More likely, this russet-red lake fueled the imagination of the great mustachioed painter, who once traveled to this far reach of Bolivia, now called Dalí Valley, looking for inspiration. The burgundy color is derived from plankton, red algae, and a trove of other microorganisms that serve as food for the lake's other outstanding feature—the rare puna flamingo, whose presence makes the place seem something like a mash-up of Mars and the Caribbean. It's one of three cold-weather flamingo species that speckle their tropical pink hues over the otherwise forbidding landscape: a 23-square-mile stretch of water beneath titanic maroon mountains, at a windswept 14,000 feet above sea level.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: World's coolest underground wonders</p>  <p>Mount Erebus, Antarctica</p>  <p>Good luck finding a spot to enjoy this lake, where the air outside can reach a frigid 60 degrees below zero and the stuff inside measures a fiery 1,700 degrees above. One of five lava lakes worldwide, Mount Erebus stands out for its location in Antarctica, the continent that lays claim to having the most ice. The pool of molten rock can be found 12,500 feet above sea level atop Mount Erebus—a volcano that has been consistently erupting since 1972. Before you even think about getting close, remember that it has been known to lob 10-foot-wide lava bombs without notice.</p>  <p>Lake Hillier, Australia</p>  <p>The source of all the world's strawberry milkshakes? Chewing gum? Pepto-Bismol? Nope, just a lake filled with perfectly pink water. It's no trick of light either; the 2,000-foot-long lake stays rosy whether day or night and keeps its hue even if taken away in a bottle. Scientists are baffled by the exact cause, although they have narrowed it down to a few microorganisms and bacteria that live in the lake's salty deposits. Lake Hillier is located on the Recherche Archipelago in Western Australia, and, as if to drive the point home, only a narrow stretch of eucalyptus-tree-covered coastline separates the bubblegum lake from the sapphire blue Southern Ocean.</p>  <p>50 states, 50 amazing natural wonders</p>  <p>Lake Superior, United States</p>  <p>Sometimes, lakes have the same muscle as oceans. Take the Great Lakes, for example. From Minnesota to Illinois to Michigan, the lakes' swollen waves have made them an unexpected haven for surfers, with northern Lake Superior known to be the best place to hang ten. A steady flow of powerful winds blowing over the surface causes the rare freshwater breakers that ""range from one to 30 feet, but average between two and six feet,"" according to Ryan Gerard, president of Third Coast Surf Shop in St. Joseph, MI (of all places). Winter's waves are usually the strongest, but any surf on these lakes is a sight for sore eyes to landlocked Midwesterners.</p>  <p>Medicine Lake, Canada</p>  <p>Within Alberta's Jasper National Park exists a lake so mysterious that you may never find it. The reason? Every winter, its water completely disappears. If you're guessing evaporation, think again: the water drains from the bottom as if it were a gigantic bathtub. Medicine Lake is in fact a four-mile-long, 100-foot-deep flood caused when melting glaciers from the surrounding mountains meet with the Maligne River. Their summer fling happens to be located directly on top of a series of sinkholes that absorb the river, sending it though a 10-mile course of underwater caves (one of the largest inaccessible places on earth), after which it appears above ground again in Maligne Canyon. Even though 4,000 gallons seep out every second, the phenomenon takes weeks. The area's indigenous residents used to call it Magic Lake, and the disappearing act remained a mystery until the 1970s, when biodegradable dye revealed the true nature of its sortilege.</p>  <p>Weirdest rock formations around the United States</p>  <p>Lake Natron, Tanzania</p>  <p>Lake Natron adds new meaning to the idea of preserving wildlife; it literally turns animals into stone. Perfectly petrified bats and birds (even doves) have been found washed ashore, as if they've suffered the cursed fate of looking into the eyes of the Greek Gorgon Medusa. The forbidding lake, whose temperatures can reach 140 degrees, developed its rare calcifying powers from toxic ash emitted by surrounding volcanoes. No one is sure exactly how the animals die, but it is thought that the lake's tremendously reflective surface tricks birds into taking a dive...from which they never recover.</p>  <p>Lake McKenzie, Australia</p>  <p>There are no more perfect puddles on earth than Lake McKenzie. To start, the impossibly snow-white sand found along its shores is made of 100 percent pure silica, a naturally occurring mineral often used in beauty products that is said to benefit hair, skin, and nails. But the lake gets more beguiling; this is the crystal-clear water that dreams are made of. Despite being located on Fraser Island, a 75-mile-long sand bar in the Coral Sea, the 370-acre lake is completely fed by freshwater from the clouds. It is one of only 80 lakes in the world that exist entirely above the groundwater table (technically called a perched lake). As a result, its only source is pure rain, which is too acidic to sustain aquatic life—plant, animal, or anything other than you, relaxing.</p>  <p>10 places we dare you to visit</p>  <p>Pavilion Lake, Canada</p>  <p>Pavilion Lake takes the nostalgia of a lakeside summer vacation to a back-in-time extreme. On the surface, it looks like any number of British Columbia's pristine alpine pools, but a peek beneath is like peering back to the beginnings of life on earth. The floor of the lake is festooned with a rare type of freshwater coral that mimics some of the first life that ever formed on this planet, no less than 2.5 billion years ago. NASA and the Canadian Space Agency have both set up shop on the lake's shores to study these living fossils for clues about how life began on earth and possibly on other planets.</p>  <p>Lake Nyos, Cameroon</p>  <p>In 1986, Lake Nyos caused one of the largest unusual natural disasters in recorded history when it literally blew up without warning. It sent a torrent of water 300 feet into the air, followed by a small tsunami to the lake's shores. Then came a burst of carbon dioxide at 60 miles an hour, creating a roving toxic cloud that suffocated 1,746 people in three days, before dispersing. Scary, but the lake is now safe to see. A buildup of carbon dioxide at the lake's bottom set off the explosion; French and American scientists have since introduced a system of piping to artificially remove the gas.</p>  <p>Dead Sea, Israel/Jordan</p>  <p>The Dead Sea is 10 times saltier than almost any other sea on earth (35 percent compared to 3.5 percent). And because one part in three is salt, you can float on its surface. Its salinity is said to have healing powers for skin and joints, and at 1,486 feet below sea level, it is the lowest place on earth. But did you trivia buffs also know that the Dead Sea is neither a sea nor dead? It is a lake sandwiched between Israel and Jordan, and since the 1930s experts have known that salt-friendly microbes call this place home. For eons it was believed that the lake's only source was the River Jordan, but in 2011, researchers discovered that it is also fed by freshwater springs on the floor.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: World's strangest lakes</p> "

""Samba, ijexa, reggae, rock, merengue, lambada, soca, salsa, zouk and other styles are energetically shaken and stirred together.""</p>  <p>Godly beats</p>  <p>Drums are also at the heart of the Afro-Brazilian religious tradition of Candomblé, which blends African beliefs with Catholic influences and has its origins in Salvador, where the first Candomblé terreiro (house of worship) was founded.</p>  <p>Candomblé is widely practiced in Bahia and has followers throughout Brazil.</p>  <p>In worship ceremonies, devotees commune with deities known as orixas through dance, chants, offerings and music rituals in which drumming plays a prominent role.</p>  <p>The beat of tall, conga-like drums, and atabaques, a conical hand drum that comes in three sizes, calls forth the deities and creates a trance-like mood for encountering the divine.</p>  <p>""The drum is very powerful to bring the orixas close to us,"" says Guedes, ""and to help us worship them.""</p>  <p>Guedes got his percussion training as a youth in the Gantois house of Candomblé, where he lived and studied with the most famous head priestess of Candomblé, Mae Menininha, celebrated in songs by pop icons Caetano Veloso and Dorival Caymmi and whose fans included the writer Jorge Amado.</p>  <p>Bloc parties</p>  <p>Candomblé also figures in another percussion-oriented tradition in Bahia, afoxe, a procession that brings Candomblé music, songs and rhythms into the streets.</p>  <p>Afoxe groups march to the beat of an ijexa rhythm tapped on atabaques, gongues (a double-bell agogo) and a gourd shaker familiar to African music also called afoxe.</p>  <p>The most famous afoxe group, the Filhos de Gandhy, began parading at Carnival in the late 1940s, inspired by the nonviolence of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>  <p>During Carnival in Brazil, people who aren't part of their city's featured parade form their own neighborhood groups, or blocos, so everyone can get in on the celebration.</p>  <p>In the 1970s, a tradition of blocos afro, all Afro-Brazilian drumming groups, developed in Bahia, led by a bloco called Ile Aiye.</p>  <p>Over the years Ile Aiye has grown to a couple thousand members, blazing a percussion trail of thundering bass drums (surdos) and tenor drums (repiques) with powerful songs about African roots and black pride.</p>  <p>Today, the best-known bloco afro is Olodum, originally an all-percussion group based in the historic heart of Salvador in the Pelourinho district.</p>  <p>The group has recorded a number of successful albums and touched off the samba-reggae style of music so popular in Bahia and across Brazil.</p>  <p>If you're in Brazil and want to get closer to the real Bahian experience, the path is easy to find: Just follow the beat.</p> "

Like Dickinson, many head to Skaneateles, one of the best towns for experiencing fall colors, according to Travel + Leisure readers who voted in the America's Favorite Towns survey.</p>  <p>The top-scoring towns represent the full color spectrum, from the blazing scarlet, orange, and deep purples of New England's hardwoods to the golden carpet of aspens covering the Rocky Mountains.</p>  <p>""Autumn leaves are nature's stained glass,"" says professional photographer Michael Clemmer, whose images have appeared in National Geographic Society publications and calendars around the world. ""They can be beautiful in moody muted light or when brightly lighted from behind.""</p>  <p>If you want to photograph autumn in all of its deciduous glory, he cautions: ""Don't shoot in the middle of the day unless it's cloudy because the bright sun washes out color. Morning and evening light are best.""</p>  <p>Clemmer's No. 1 rule? ""Don't let taking photos keep you from enjoying the scenery.""</p>  <p>Check out these favorite fall-foliage towns, from Colorado to Vermont, and then get out there to see the colors for yourself.</p>  <p>1 . Oakland, Maryland</p>  <p>Oakland took top honors as the best town in America for leaf-peeping, thanks primarily to the blazing colors found just nine miles north of town at Swallow Falls State Park. As the Youghiogheny River flows through rock gorges, the oldest stands of eastern hemlock and white pine—more than 360 years old—blanket the area in gold, orange and red.</p>  <p>For five days in early October, residents turn out for the annual Autumn Glory Festival, including two parades, concerts and band competitions. Oakland also embraces the Halloween spirit, hosting a hayride along the lakefront that passes scenes of zombies and ghosts.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: America's best cities for fall travel</p>  <p>2. Lake Placid, New York</p>  <p>The Adirondack Mountains are famed for their fall colors, and T+L readers gave Lake Placid the silver medal for autumn foliage. Red and silver maples, birch, aspen, oaks and beech trees stretch out along the Olympic Trail scenic byway (which runs through Lake Placid), providing a striking show of color for its 170 miles.</p>  <p>Or take the Fall Foliage Train tour on the Adirondack Scenic Railroad. Prime viewing time tends to be in early to mid-October, which conveniently coincides with the Lake Placid Brewfest.</p>  <p>3. Stillwater, Minnesota</p>  <p>When the leaves start showing their colors in Stillwater—on the western banks of the St. Croix River dividing Minnesota and Wisconsin—visitors converge on the town's many Victorian bed-and-breakfast inns.</p>  <p>One of the best ways to take in nature's show is by river cruise on a replica of an 1890s paddleboat. Autumn here kicks off with the annual grape stomp competition, with prizes given for best style, and it culminates in the long-running fine-art and music festival.</p>  <p>4. Stowe, Vermont</p>  <p>As the air gets crisp in Stowe, the sugar maples come alive in intense shades of gold, orange and scarlet blanketing the surrounding Green and Worcester mountain ranges. In general, the best time to capture these brilliant hues is the end of September through mid-October; the Trapp Family Lodge (""the family that inspired The Sound of Music"") makes a charming base of operations, especially during the popular Stowe Oktoberfest.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: America's best fall color drives</p>  <p>5.Ludlow, Vermont</p>  <p>Before the snow bunnies take over Okemo Mountain and its ski resort, the 3,344-foot peak is one of the loveliest places in the valley for fall colors—with a 360-degree view that includes the Green Mountains to the west and the Okemo Valley region to the east.</p>  <p>Just drive to the top, park, and hike the short distance to the fire tower. Other prime viewing spots are along the nearby Scenic Route 100 Byway: the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site and Coolidge State Park, both affording panoramic, mountaintop views.</p>  <p>6. Portsmouth, New Hampshire</p>  <p>Like so many New England towns, Portsmouth is awash in early American history. At Strawbery Banke Museum—a 10-acre outdoor museum—you can take in the fall color as you roam the waterfront district and its restored homes built in the mid-1600s.</p>  <p>By car, watch the foliage as you drive down the 18-mile scenic Coastal Byway. Or leave the driving to the captain on a 2.5-hour inland river cruise highlighting foliage and local lore.</p>  <p>7. Whitefish, Montana</p>  <p>The mountains framing Whitefish—doorway to Glacier National Park in the Flathead Valley—are a dramatic study in contrasts in autumn, when the golden aspen and larch flash against a backdrop of dark evergreens.</p>  <p>Kayaking or canoeing on Whitefish Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in the West, is one of the best ways to catch views of Big Mountain and the forests around it. If you prefer driving, follow Highway 35 along the east side of the lake and return in time to polka the night away at the annual two-weekend Oktoberfest.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: Best carry-on luggage</p>  <p>8. Snowmass Village, Colorado</p>  <p>Snowmass Village and nearby Aspen—which bears the name of Colorado's most ubiquitous tree—are visited only briefly by autumn. But catch it while you can because it's one of the best times to explore this area, with seasonably mild days and not-too-cold nights, and the predictable celebrity sightings when the Aspen Film Festival rolls into town.</p>  <p>The preferred local ways to experience fall color are biking and hiking, whether it's along the exceptionally beautiful Crater Lake Trail near Maroon Bells or the moderate Smuggler's Loop at Hunter Creek.</p>  <p>9. Lake Geneva, Wisconsin</p>  <p>When Chicago's upper crust started putting up mansions on Lake Geneva in the late 19th century, they enlisted some of the top landscape architects to design grounds and plant trees that would showcase autumn colors for as long as possible, from early September through November.</p>  <p>Three-mile-long Snake Road on the north end of the lake is one of the best drives in the fall, or enjoy a fall foliage cruise. Better yet, splurge on a view from a hot air balloon.</p>  <p>10. Glenwood Springs, Colorado</p>  <p>Autumn can start making an appearance as soon as early September in these parts, and leaf-peepers trek to Glenwood Springs in droves to watch summer green change to aspen gold at the confluence of the Colorado and Roaring Fork rivers. Bike or hike along the 44-mile Rio Grande Trail that leads up to Aspen.</p>  <p>If you have to pick a drive, choose the one over Independence Pass, where a short hike will bring you to a summit overlooking 18 mountains higher than 14,000 feet. You can even choose to leaf peep by Segway. Back in Glenwood Springs, relax at the world's largest natural hot springs pool.</p>  <p>See all the top towns for fall colors</p> "

But given the news of the past week, it's hard not to worry.</p>  <p>Affected passengers may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta.</p>  <p>Case in point: Thomas Eric Duncan , the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S., was screened for the virus before departing Liberia for the United States on September 19, but he didn't show symptoms until he had been in Dallas for a few days. People who came into contact with him in the United States are being tracked down for monitoring.</p>  <p>How can air travelers stay calm?</p>  <p>Travel blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala , reached on Thursday at 35,000 feet flying from Toronto to Honolulu via Los Angeles, takes a few additional steps to keep calm.</p>  <p>DiScala, who visits 20 countries and flies about 150,000 miles annually, knows how Ebola is transmitted and isn't concerned about catching it. But he refuses to read stories about the disease to avoid panicking.</p>  <p>DiScala also carries surgical masks, which he will wear and offer to travelers ""coughing and sneezing on me.""</p>  <p>Several airlines report they are following all U.S. Centers for Disease Controls protocols for keeping people with contagious diseases off their aircrafts.

This is done to prevent transmission of common diseases, like the flu, via surfaces such as armrests. And it is much tougher to catch Ebola than the flu.</p>  <p>How Ebola spreads</p>  <p>In one CDC study, the Ebola virus lived in a perfectly controlled environment for up to six days. But the environment at an airport, for example, is not perfectly suited to support viruses.</p>  <p>It's unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, said Dr. Marty Cetron , director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.</p>  <p>""This is not an airborne transmission,"" Cetron told CNN.

Hays, now 25, says he visited Joyland at least twice each summer when he was a kid in the 1990s.</p>  <p>After moving back to his hometown earlier this year, Hays wanted to revisit his childhood amusement park. But he couldn't. Joyland was no more.</p>  <p>The theme park, which had been operating for 55 years, closed in 2004. What Hays found instead was a heap of scraps from a forgotten place. With a camera in hand, the web designer walked carefully through the tall fields of grass that now surround much of the abandoned remnants of the theme park.</p>  <p>Within the confines of Joyland, Hays was hit with a rush of memories from his youth. ""My older brother and I would beg my parents to take us,"" Hays said. ""When we got there, we would ride the same three rides over and over again.""</p>  <p>Those deep feelings of nostalgia associated with places like local, homegrown theme parks are quite common, according to Jim Futrell, a historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Association. ""In this Internet era, people are looking for something different to do, and a lot of amusement parks are able to capitalize on that,"" he said.</p>  <p>Attendance at U.S. theme parks increased by 59 million visitors from 2000 to 2013, said David Mandt, a spokesman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.</p>  <p>The jump in attendance is positive news for an industry that historically goes through cycles of park closures. From 2004 to 2008, amusement parks hit a slump with dozens of theme parks shutting their doors nationwide.</p>  <p>This includes several smaller theme parks that closed in the mid-2000s, including some that had survived a century, Futrell said. Ohio's Geauga Lake and Pennsylvania's Bushkill Park, were examples of this trend, Futrell wrote in a 2006 article for Funworld Magazine .</p>  <p>Those smaller theme park closures have left a void for some intrepid travelers who are looking for a more nostalgic amusement park experience.</p>  <p>Our fascination with abandoned buildings</p>  <p>Jessica Georgia is one of those travelers who is always searching for a vintage or ""Old Americana"" place to explore. It's what brought her and her family to the gates of Land of Oz , a relic theme park, sitting all alone on top of Beech Mountain in North Carolina. Georgia stumbled onto the theme park while doing an online search for interesting places to visit with her family. There wasn't much information she could find on Land of Oz, except that it once operated in the 1970s before closing its doors.</p>  <p>What she did find online were photos of a real-life version of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Its yellow bricks, steel gate and lush green trees sparked her curiosity.</p>  <p>She and her family visited the park in late May and found that the gates to the theme park were open, so they stepped inside. Georgia, her husband and daughter walked carefully down the yellow brick road. The path was still brightly colored after all these years, with a few bricks missing here and there.</p>  <p>""I don't think you are supposed to walk in the way we did,"" she said. ""The gates are there, there were the yellow bricks, and the shell of what used to be a castle. The Tin Man was also there, and the trees looked like they were looking at you.""</p>  <p>Land of Oz may seem like an abandoned theme park, but it's actually not. The amusement park is closed, and the space has been converted into vacation rental property. Visitors can rent out Dorothy's house, which looks like an antique cottage, for two nights or more. Other parts of the park can also be rented for small events.</p>  <p>The theme park hasn't been operational since the 1980s, when it first shut down. But the space went through a revival in the 1990s, according to Cynthia Keller, the property manager of Land of Oz and self-appointed ""Keeper of Oz.""</p>  <p>Libraries are dying? Think again</p>  <p>""You get the grounds to yourself, and you can stroll the yellow brick road,"" Keller said. ""We have been doing vacation rentals for the last 20 years.""</p>  <p>Spending the night in Dorothy's home and waking up on top of a picturesque mountain is an experience that keeps the park's rental calendar pretty much booked up, Keller said. Even those who aren't hardcore fans of the classic Technicolor movie enjoy spending time at the converted theme park.</p>  <p>""We aren't crazy about 'The Wizard of Oz,' but I definitely had some nostalgia walking through,"" Georgia said. ""I had a lot of childhood memories of watching that movie with my sister when we were little, and being able to pass that experience down to my daughter. It makes you want to be a kid again.""</p>  <p>Hays says going to Joyland with his parents always felt like a treat, giving him a ""special feeling that is hard to recreate or describe once you have grown up.""</p>  <p>Although Hays doesn't have children yet, he hopes to share that same feeling with his own kids in the future. He plans on taking them to a theme park similar to Joyland.</p>  <p>""There is something about local amusement parks,"" he said. ""When you go to Six Flags, I don't think you have the same emotional connection to that park like a smaller theme park gives you.""</p> "

It turns out the federal government is concerned about it, too.</p>  <p>Marriott has agreed to pay a $600,000 fine after the Federal Communications Commission found the company blocked consumer Wi-Fi networks last year during an event at a hotel and conference center in Nashville.</p>  <p>At the same time, Marriott was charging exhibitors and others as much as $1,000 per device to access the hotel's wireless network, the FCC announced Friday .</p>  <p>""Consumers who purchase cellular data plans should be able to use them without fear that their personal Internet connection will be blocked by their hotel or conference center,"" FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a statement.</p>  <p>Federal law prohibits people from using a device that interferes with cellular, GPS or wireless networks.</p>  <p>It's the first time the FCC has investigated a hotel property for blocking its guests' Wi-Fi, according to a senior FCC official with knowledge of the investigation. The unlawful blocking isn't ""jamming"" in the traditional sense, where someone uses a jammer device to block wireless signals. Instead, Marriott employees were using the hotel's own Wi-Fi system to block other people's hot spots, the FCC official said.</p>  <p>The order doesn't just affect one Marriott property.</p>  <p>Under the FCC consent decree, Marriott must not block guests' Wi-Fi at all of the properties it owns and manages. The company must also file compliance plans with the FCC every three months for three years.</p>  <p>A federal investigation of the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville found that Marriott employees had used ""containment features of a Wi-Fi monitoring system"" at the hotel to prevent people from accessing their own personal Wi-Fi networks.</p>  <p>""It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hot spots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network,"" LeBlanc said. ""This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether.""</p>  <p>The Boogie Down Bronx</p>  <p>Marriott issued the following statement Friday afternoon defending its actions:</p>  <p>""Marriott has a strong interest in ensuring that when our guests use our Wi-Fi service, they will be protected from rogue wireless hot spots that can cause degraded service, insidious cyber-attacks and identity theft,"" the statement said.

Like Dickinson, many head to Skaneateles, one of the best towns for experiencing fall colors, according to Travel + Leisure readers who voted in the America's Favorite Towns survey.</p>  <p>The top-scoring towns represent the full color spectrum, from the blazing scarlet, orange, and deep purples of New England's hardwoods to the golden carpet of aspens covering the Rocky Mountains.</p>  <p>""Autumn leaves are nature's stained glass,"" says professional photographer Michael Clemmer, whose images have appeared in National Geographic Society publications and calendars around the world. ""They can be beautiful in moody muted light or when brightly lighted from behind.""</p>  <p>If you want to photograph autumn in all of its deciduous glory, he cautions: ""Don't shoot in the middle of the day unless it's cloudy because the bright sun washes out color. Morning and evening light are best.""</p>  <p>Clemmer's No. 1 rule? ""Don't let taking photos keep you from enjoying the scenery.""</p>  <p>Check out these favorite fall-foliage towns, from Colorado to Vermont, and then get out there to see the colors for yourself.</p>  <p>1 . Oakland, Maryland</p>  <p>Oakland took top honors as the best town in America for leaf-peeping, thanks primarily to the blazing colors found just nine miles north of town at Swallow Falls State Park. As the Youghiogheny River flows through rock gorges, the oldest stands of eastern hemlock and white pine—more than 360 years old—blanket the area in gold, orange and red.</p>  <p>For five days in early October, residents turn out for the annual Autumn Glory Festival, including two parades, concerts and band competitions. Oakland also embraces the Halloween spirit, hosting a hayride along the lakefront that passes scenes of zombies and ghosts.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: America's best cities for fall travel</p>  <p>2. Lake Placid, New York</p>  <p>The Adirondack Mountains are famed for their fall colors, and T+L readers gave Lake Placid the silver medal for autumn foliage. Red and silver maples, birch, aspen, oaks and beech trees stretch out along the Olympic Trail scenic byway (which runs through Lake Placid), providing a striking show of color for its 170 miles.</p>  <p>Or take the Fall Foliage Train tour on the Adirondack Scenic Railroad. Prime viewing time tends to be in early to mid-October, which conveniently coincides with the Lake Placid Brewfest.</p>  <p>3. Stillwater, Minnesota</p>  <p>When the leaves start showing their colors in Stillwater—on the western banks of the St. Croix River dividing Minnesota and Wisconsin—visitors converge on the town's many Victorian bed-and-breakfast inns.</p>  <p>One of the best ways to take in nature's show is by river cruise on a replica of an 1890s paddleboat. Autumn here kicks off with the annual grape stomp competition, with prizes given for best style, and it culminates in the long-running fine-art and music festival.</p>  <p>4. Stowe, Vermont</p>  <p>As the air gets crisp in Stowe, the sugar maples come alive in intense shades of gold, orange and scarlet blanketing the surrounding Green and Worcester mountain ranges. In general, the best time to capture these brilliant hues is the end of September through mid-October; the Trapp Family Lodge (""the family that inspired The Sound of Music"") makes a charming base of operations, especially during the popular Stowe Oktoberfest.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: America's best fall color drives</p>  <p>5.Ludlow, Vermont</p>  <p>Before the snow bunnies take over Okemo Mountain and its ski resort, the 3,344-foot peak is one of the loveliest places in the valley for fall colors—with a 360-degree view that includes the Green Mountains to the west and the Okemo Valley region to the east.</p>  <p>Just drive to the top, park, and hike the short distance to the fire tower. Other prime viewing spots are along the nearby Scenic Route 100 Byway: the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site and Coolidge State Park, both affording panoramic, mountaintop views.</p>  <p>6. Portsmouth, New Hampshire</p>  <p>Like so many New England towns, Portsmouth is awash in early American history. At Strawbery Banke Museum—a 10-acre outdoor museum—you can take in the fall color as you roam the waterfront district and its restored homes built in the mid-1600s.</p>  <p>By car, watch the foliage as you drive down the 18-mile scenic Coastal Byway. Or leave the driving to the captain on a 2.5-hour inland river cruise highlighting foliage and local lore.</p>  <p>7. Whitefish, Montana</p>  <p>The mountains framing Whitefish—doorway to Glacier National Park in the Flathead Valley—are a dramatic study in contrasts in autumn, when the golden aspen and larch flash against a backdrop of dark evergreens.</p>  <p>Kayaking or canoeing on Whitefish Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in the West, is one of the best ways to catch views of Big Mountain and the forests around it. If you prefer driving, follow Highway 35 along the east side of the lake and return in time to polka the night away at the annual two-weekend Oktoberfest.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: Best carry-on luggage</p>  <p>8. Snowmass Village, Colorado</p>  <p>Snowmass Village and nearby Aspen—which bears the name of Colorado's most ubiquitous tree—are visited only briefly by autumn. But catch it while you can because it's one of the best times to explore this area, with seasonably mild days and not-too-cold nights, and the predictable celebrity sightings when the Aspen Film Festival rolls into town.</p>  <p>The preferred local ways to experience fall color are biking and hiking, whether it's along the exceptionally beautiful Crater Lake Trail near Maroon Bells or the moderate Smuggler's Loop at Hunter Creek.</p>  <p>9. Lake Geneva, Wisconsin</p>  <p>When Chicago's upper crust started putting up mansions on Lake Geneva in the late 19th century, they enlisted some of the top landscape architects to design grounds and plant trees that would showcase autumn colors for as long as possible, from early September through November.</p>  <p>Three-mile-long Snake Road on the north end of the lake is one of the best drives in the fall, or enjoy a fall foliage cruise. Better yet, splurge on a view from a hot air balloon.</p>  <p>10. Glenwood Springs, Colorado</p>  <p>Autumn can start making an appearance as soon as early September in these parts, and leaf-peepers trek to Glenwood Springs in droves to watch summer green change to aspen gold at the confluence of the Colorado and Roaring Fork rivers. Bike or hike along the 44-mile Rio Grande Trail that leads up to Aspen.</p>  <p>If you have to pick a drive, choose the one over Independence Pass, where a short hike will bring you to a summit overlooking 18 mountains higher than 14,000 feet. You can even choose to leaf peep by Segway. Back in Glenwood Springs, relax at the world's largest natural hot springs pool.</p>  <p>See all the top towns for fall colors</p> "

But given the news of the past week, it's hard not to worry.</p>  <p>Affected passengers may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta.</p>  <p>Case in point: Thomas Eric Duncan , the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S., was screened for the virus before departing Liberia for the United States on September 19, but he didn't show symptoms until he had been in Dallas for a few days. People who came into contact with him in the United States are being tracked down for monitoring.</p>  <p>How can air travelers stay calm?</p>  <p>Travel blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala , reached on Thursday at 35,000 feet flying from Toronto to Honolulu via Los Angeles, takes a few additional steps to keep calm.</p>  <p>DiScala, who visits 20 countries and flies about 150,000 miles annually, knows how Ebola is transmitted and isn't concerned about catching it. But he refuses to read stories about the disease to avoid panicking.</p>  <p>DiScala also carries surgical masks, which he will wear and offer to travelers ""coughing and sneezing on me.""</p>  <p>Several airlines report they are following all U.S. Centers for Disease Controls protocols for keeping people with contagious diseases off their aircrafts. But a handful declined to give specifics about whether they're now doing anything differently on U.S. domestic flights.</p>  <p>Airplanes are given light cleanings between flights, a much heavier daily cleaning and even more on down time, experts tell CNN. This is done to prevent transmission of common diseases, like the flu, via surfaces such as armrests. And it is much tougher to catch Ebola than the flu.</p>  <p>How Ebola spreads</p>  <p>In one CDC study, the Ebola virus lived in a perfectly controlled environment for up to six days. But the environment at an airport, for example, is not perfectly suited to support viruses.</p>  <p>It's unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, said Dr. Marty Cetron , director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.</p>  <p>""This is not an airborne transmission,"" Cetron told CNN.

A thrilling flight on an endangered warbird","CNN.com","2014-10-02 13:07:17","2014-10-06 05:56:36","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/02/travel/preserving-military-airplanes/index.html","Travel"," <p>It's 70 years old, and in a few minutes, I'll know firsthand if this old warbird can still fly.</p>  <p>In all, nearly 13,000 B-17 Flying Fortresses rolled off the assembly lines. Now, only about a dozen flying B-17s remain -- in the entire world.</p>  <p>These are the famous bombers that helped the Allies win World War II. Every year planes like these are retired to aviation junkyards, destined for a rusty demise.</p>  <p>But there's a group out there working to preserve the precious legacy of these planes by keeping them flying.</p>  <p>OK, that's all nice and everything -- but it's not really at the top of my mind.</p>  <p>Right now, I'm just trying to fit inside this thing, along with seven other passengers.</p>  <p>Getting aboard involves stepping up a short ladder and ducking through a small hatch in the back of the plane.</p>  <p>Seat cushions? Surely you jest. Instead, the B-17 offers webbed, canvas seats bolted to the side walls of the cabin. They make seating on a small regional jet comfortable by comparison.</p>  <p>Seat belt: check.</p>  <p>Camera: yep.</p>  <p>Ready for an unforgettable flight? You bet.</p>  <p>I need to pay attention. Bill, our host, is announcing something important. ""Whatever you do,"" Bill tells us, ""don't touch the overhead cables.""</p>  <p>There they are -- just a couple of feet above me. The wire cables directly connect cockpit controls in the front of the plane to the tail rudder and ""elevators"" in the back. Basically, they help steer the plane. So yeah, we kind of need those to work. Note to self: Don't touch the cables.</p>  <p>Tip No. 2: Stay away from the bomb bay doors. They can probably hold no more than 110 pounds. Any heavier than that, Bill says, you'll be doing some unplanned skydiving without a parachute. By the way, there ARE parachutes on this ancient plane, right?</p>  <p>Nope, says Bill.</p>  <p>As the plane's four propeller engines sputter to life, I'm tweeting (with misspelled words) about how LOUD they are and how they're spewing the smell of oil. ""A great sound and smell,"" Stephen L Avery tweets back.</p>  <p>Inches from my head sits a replica machine gun. Near that, a side window with a view of the plane's whirling propellers.</p>  <p>Before I know it, the pilot is gunning the engines and we're accelerating down the runway. It's bumpy, deafening -- and we're airborne!</p>  <p>Bill indicates it's safe to stand up and walk around -- although there isn't much to grab on to. This waist gunner station -- because gunners stand up in the middle of the aircraft -- was the most dangerous job on the aircraft because they were so easily targeted.</p>  <p>Images of faceless military crew members who've flown aboard this plane cross my mind and -- WHOA! -- the plane takes a surprise left bank 1,600 feet above Atlanta! Hold on!</p>  <p>Keep in mind no one is shooting at us. Combat conditions here were uncomfortable at best: no temperature-controlled, pressurized cabins. Imagine trying to fight off enemy planes amid the overwhelming roar and the freezing cold seeping in from outside.</p>  <p>I'm not the only aviation geek who's awestruck. I look around to see other passengers who clearly get it: Flying aboard this plane puts them a little closer to history -- and a lot closer than they'd feel in a dimly lit aviation museum.</p>  <p>They're trading smartphones and taking photos of each other, to treasure the moment. ""I can't wait to tell my dad about this,"" one avgeek tells me.</p>  <p>At one point I step carefully across a gun ball turret embedded into the floor, where a small gunner would fire on enemy planes. A stiff wind whips into my face through a quarter-inch-wide gap between the turret and the plane's body. Waaaaay down below I can see the trees and homes of Atlanta rushing by at about 160 mph.</p>  <p>That's solid ground down there!</p>  <p>Despite the windy gaps, the B-17 was named the Flying Fortress for a reason. Its resilient design gained a reputation for taking a beating and still bringing its crew home alive.</p>  <p>As for this crew, the pilot starts lining up with the runway and we're told to buckle up. We touch down on the runway. The old-fashioned tires give a weird little yelp. Our 20-minute adventure is over.</p>  <p>For me, the stories I'd read in history books had come to life. The experience was nothing short of thrilling.</p>  <p>These refurbished warbirds are as close as most of us will ever come to understanding the horror and stress of aerial combat during WW II.</p>  <p>Amazingly, some are still able to fly across the nation, visiting air shows from coast to coast.</p>  <p>Last weekend, ""Sentimental Journey"" -- the plane I flew on -- traveled from its home base in Arizona to Atlanta's DeKalb Peachtree Airport. The planes are operated by the Commemorative Air Force, a national group which has been working to restore and maintain flying warbirds since 1957.</p>  <p>Events like these offer younger generations a living, breathing, real-world lesson about these planes' contribution to history. ""Unlike static museums, you can go out and see them in their natural state,"" says Steve Brown, CAF president. ""You get the oil, the smoke, the smell. You can ride inside them and imagine.""</p>  <p>During battle, P-51 Mustangs often escorted B-17s for protection -- engaging in dogfights with enemy fighters, if need be. They were among the fastest and most nimble fighter planes of the era. Less than a few hundred are still flying today.</p>  <p>""You don't really have time for emotions"" during dogfights, says ex-Mustang pilot Robert ""Punchy"" Powell. Powell escorted B-17s during the 1944 D-Day Allied invasion of France. ""You're not thinking too much about what you have to do. You do it because you've been trained to do it, and your experience makes you do what you're supposed to do.""</p>  <p>Now 93, Powell destroyed six enemy planes between September 1943 and August of '44 as part of the U.S. Army Air Force's 352nd Fighter Group ""Bluenosed Bastards of Bodney,"" out of Bodney, England.</p>  <p>Mustangs were made for two things: shooting and speed. They bristled with guns and boasted a top speed of about 300 mph . ""It wasn't hard to fly,"" Powell says. ""It was a very stable, easy airplane.""</p>  <p>On D-Day, Powell took off from England toward France during a night mission to escort B-17s.</p>  <p>Later that day, Powell's squadron was among more than 1,000 fighters in the air shooting up ""convoys, tanks and trains and buses and motorcycles -- whatever moved toward the beaches.""</p>  <p>When he first sat down inside a Mustang cockpit, Powell was only 21 years old.</p>  <p>""All of us can reflect on what were doing at age 19, 20,"" says the CAF's Brown, a former Army aviator. ""Now put yourself in these complex airplanes, flying thousands of miles over water, away from home to drop bombs while you're being attacked. It's pretty amazing to think about.""</p>  <p>Related story: D-Day paratrooper jumps again, 70 years later</p>  <p>The CAF operates 162 restored warplanes from WWII and beyond and shows them at air shows and airports across the U.S . ""to educate Americans about what these aircraft did -- and what role they played in our freedom,"" says Brown. The air shows help fund its $24 million yearly budget, along with membership fees and donations. Its members number about 12,000.</p>  <p>By next year, the CAF plans to move its headquarters from Midland, Texas, to a small executive airport southwest of downtown Dallas . There, the group plans to build a $40-million, world-class aviation museum.</p>  <p>""We expect to attract a quarter million visitors a year or more,"" Brown says. ""And we'll have aircraft on display in a unique venue.""</p>  <p>Powell says ""the glamour days are over."" He knows dogfighting is all but obsolete as more aircraft attack by using precise, long-range guided missiles.</p>  <p>""In the future, most of the air combat will be what they're beginning to do today: long-distance firing and drones,"" Powell says. ""Recently, I heard a general say that the last fighter pilot has already been born. It takes about 20 years to raise and train a fighter pilot. Imagine what the technology will be in 20 years. In the future, there won't be any dogfighting.""</p>  <p>As the ""greatest generation"" passes on, Brown says America's youngest generation has no understanding of WWII and what it was like to defend the nation during those dark times. With that in mind, the CAF sees itself as much more than a group of warplane enthusiasts.</p>  <p>""We're here to inspire,"" Brown says. ""We can use the inspiration of what they accomplished then to inspire us accomplish great things in the future.""</p> "

Hays, now 25, says he visited Joyland at least twice each summer when he was a kid in the 1990s.</p>  <p>After moving back to his hometown earlier this year, Hays wanted to revisit his childhood amusement park. But he couldn't. Joyland was no more.</p>  <p>The theme park, which had been operating for 55 years, closed in 2004. What Hays found instead was a heap of scraps from a forgotten place. With a camera in hand, the web designer walked carefully through the tall fields of grass that now surround much of the abandoned remnants of the theme park.</p>  <p>Within the confines of Joyland, Hays was hit with a rush of memories from his youth. ""My older brother and I would beg my parents to take us,"" Hays said. ""When we got there, we would ride the same three rides over and over again.""</p>  <p>Those deep feelings of nostalgia associated with places like local, homegrown theme parks are quite common, according to Jim Futrell, a historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Association. ""In this Internet era, people are looking for something different to do, and a lot of amusement parks are able to capitalize on that,"" he said.</p>  <p>Attendance at U.S. theme parks increased by 59 million visitors from 2000 to 2013, said David Mandt, a spokesman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.</p>  <p>The jump in attendance is positive news for an industry that historically goes through cycles of park closures. From 2004 to 2008, amusement parks hit a slump with dozens of theme parks shutting their doors nationwide.</p>  <p>This includes several smaller theme parks that closed in the mid-2000s, including some that had survived a century, Futrell said. Ohio's Geauga Lake and Pennsylvania's Bushkill Park, were examples of this trend, Futrell wrote in a 2006 article for Funworld Magazine .</p>  <p>Those smaller theme park closures have left a void for some intrepid travelers who are looking for a more nostalgic amusement park experience.</p>  <p>Our fascination with abandoned buildings</p>  <p>Jessica Georgia is one of those travelers who is always searching for a vintage or ""Old Americana"" place to explore. It's what brought her and her family to the gates of Land of Oz , a relic theme park, sitting all alone on top of Beech Mountain in North Carolina. Georgia stumbled onto the theme park while doing an online search for interesting places to visit with her family. There wasn't much information she could find on Land of Oz, except that it once operated in the 1970s before closing its doors.</p>  <p>What she did find online were photos of a real-life version of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Its yellow bricks, steel gate and lush green trees sparked her curiosity.</p>  <p>She and her family visited the park in late May and found that the gates to the theme park were open, so they stepped inside. Georgia, her husband and daughter walked carefully down the yellow brick road. The path was still brightly colored after all these years, with a few bricks missing here and there.</p>  <p>""I don't think you are supposed to walk in the way we did,"" she said. ""The gates are there, there were the yellow bricks, and the shell of what used to be a castle. The Tin Man was also there, and the trees looked like they were looking at you.""</p>  <p>Land of Oz may seem like an abandoned theme park, but it's actually not. The amusement park is closed, and the space has been converted into vacation rental property. Visitors can rent out Dorothy's house, which looks like an antique cottage, for two nights or more. Other parts of the park can also be rented for small events.</p>  <p>The theme park hasn't been operational since the 1980s, when it first shut down.

Even those who aren't hardcore fans of the classic Technicolor movie enjoy spending time at the converted theme park.</p>  <p>""We aren't crazy about 'The Wizard of Oz,' but I definitely had some nostalgia walking through,"" Georgia said. ""I had a lot of childhood memories of watching that movie with my sister when we were little, and being able to pass that experience down to my daughter. It makes you want to be a kid again.""</p>  <p>Hays says going to Joyland with his parents always felt like a treat, giving him a ""special feeling that is hard to recreate or describe once you have grown up.""</p>  <p>Although Hays doesn't have children yet, he hopes to share that same feeling with his own kids in the future. He plans on taking them to a theme park similar to Joyland.</p>  <p>""There is something about local amusement parks,"" he said.

We've pinpointed affordable island hotels that span the globe, from destinations usually reserved for big spenders to others barely on the radar of most travelers. All of our favorites have room rates that start below $200—some as low as $70. And these hotels have more going for them than price point, whether it's an oceanfront location or cozy charm.</p>  <p>Whatever your idea of paradise, we think you'll agree that every gem on our list deserves treasure island status.</p>  <p>Lefkes Village Hotel, Paros, Greece</p>  <p>Part of the Cyclades, Paros delivers all the archetypal Greek island draws—whitewashed churches, bougainvillea-festooned houses, panoramic Aegean views—without the high prices of neighboring hot spots Santorini and Mykonos. Case in point: this 20-room contemporary hotel in the quiet mountain village of Lefkes, with a swimming pool, a small museum, and a tavern that uses ingredients gathered from the surrounding fruit trees and gardens. From $70.</p>  <p>La Veranda Resort, Vietnam</p>  <p>The island of Phu Quoc (the country's largest) is firmly on the tourist radar these days, yet it still retains the serene small-town essence that first drew intrepid travelers to its balmy shores. This elegant two-story resort radiates French colonial-era charm: airy rooms with net-draped beds with either lush tropical garden or ocean views, a dining room serving Pan Pacific cuisine on a long veranda beneath lazy ceiling fans, and a clubby lounge bar with scarlet walls. From $140.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: Best U.S. cities for affordable getaways</p>  <p>Copamarina Beach Resort & Spa, Puerto Rico</p>  <p>Copamarina occupies prime oceanfront real estate on Puerto Rico's less-explored southern coast, complete with a palm-fringed beach and 20 acres of tropical gardens. It's a setting that more than makes up for any style shortcomings. Take advantage of the recently updated on-site spa, two seafood-oriented restaurants, and several pools, or venture farther afield. The historic seaside town of Guánica is within walking distance; nearby adventures include bird-watching in Dry Forest Reserve and snorkeling by tiny Gilligan's Island. From $145.</p>  <p>Fairbanks House, Amelia Island, Florida</p>  <p>Amelia Island combines the Spanish moss-draped romance of the South with a laid-back tropical ambience. And this boutique Italianate-style villa is the perfect base from which to take it all in. The historic building (est. 1885) displays all manner of over-the-top details: dormers, bay windows, massive chimneys, balustraded balconies, and a 15-foot tower. Rooms feature canopy or four-poster beds, fireplaces, and bathrooms that will thrill any nostalgics yearning to soak in a Victorian-era claw-foot tub. From $180.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: Best affordable all-inclusive resorts</p>  <p>Fishers' Loft, Newfoundland, Canada</p>  <p>Overlooking Trinity Bay and the harbor of Ship Cove, Fishers' Loft is found on one of Atlantic Canada's most fascinating, idiosyncratic islands. Designed in the clapboard-and-shingles style of the late 1800s, this cozy inn evokes Newfoundland's seafaring past; guests have the chance to spot whales and icebergs out the mullioned windows, depending on the season. Meals are sourced with ingredients gathered from the inn's greenhouse and gardens. From $99.</p>  <p>Auberge Seraphine, St. Lucia</p>  <p>A big hit with honeymooners, the lush Caribbean island of St. Lucia can also take a big hit on your wallet, thanks to its slew of high-end resorts. Not so at this sweet family-run hotel near Castries on the northwest coast. There's no beach here, but the auberge has a lovely pool and is on sailboat-packed Vielle Bay, close to a large lily pad--filled pond popular with hundreds of white egrets. Snag a table at the on-site restaurant for seafood risotto and lobster. From $125.</p>  <p>Rosario Resort & Spa, Orcas Island, Washington</p>  <p>For an island getaway with a dose of history, consider this quaint 40-acre resort on the largest of Washington State's San Juan Islands, overlooking East Sound and Cascade Bay. Rosario shares land with Moran Mansion, the magnificent former home of shipbuilder and onetime Seattle mayor Robert Moran. It's now a museum featuring archival photographs, model ships, and an impressive collection of Arts and Crafts furnishings amassed by Moran. From $99.</p>  <p>Travel + Leisure: Best places to spend Christmas</p>  <p>Villa Serena, Dominican Republic</p>  <p>Word has spread about the Samaná peninsula, an unspoiled stretch of coastline in the island's northeast corner, far from the madding crowds of the Puerto Cana resort region. Part of the peninsula's appeal is its bevy of stylish small hotels, among them, Villa Serena on Las Galeras Bay. It has all the classic Caribbean colonial features -- Palladian arches, wooden shutters, acres of white gingerbread trim—set in sprawling tropical gardens just steps from the sand. Daily alfresco yoga sessions overlooking the ocean are a highlight. From $110.</p>  <p>Sangat Island Dive Resort, Palawan, Philippines</p>  <p>It's not hard to understand why T+L readers voted Palawan their favorite island in the 2013 World's Best survey; the lightly populated archipelago shows off the sublime underwater richness of the Philippines. After diving or snorkeling in the surrounding coral reef, retreat back to your cottage at this low-key resort at the foot of towering limestone cliffs. Simple tropical furnishings—bamboo floors and walls, bright textiles, and terraces slung with hammocks—keep the focus on the outrageously beautiful ocean views.

In Istanbul, the brand-new Shangri-La Bosphorus brings opulence to the banks of the river in the form of elegant rooms converted from a former tobacco warehouse. And the remote Fabriken Furillen, once a limestone refinery, is an isolated 16-room property on a Swedish island, where neighbors are few but the scenery is stunning.</p>  <p>Here are seven cutting-edge hotels that come from humble origins.</p>  <p>Your most spectacular travel photos</p>  <p>1888 Hotel, Sydney</p>  <p>One of Sydney's trendiest accommodations, 1888 Hotel opened its doors in July, welcoming guests to its 90-room boutique property in the Pyrmont neighborhood. The guest rooms feature 10-foot ceilings; windows and desks constructed from recycled timber; and a lobby, an atrium and a bar studded with reclaimed wooden beams and exposed brick.</p>  <p>Despite the vintage details, the five-story hotel takes a modern approach to technology: Each room comes with an iPad and Instagram users with more than 10,000 followers are entitled to one complimentary night's stay. The staff wears denim work shirts in a cheeky nod to the heritage-listed building's previous life as a woolshed. Rooms start at $150; 139 Murray St.; 61-2/8586-1888; 8hotels.com .</p>  <p>Fabriken Furillen, Gotland, Sweden</p>  <p>While most former industrial buildings are found in ports or in cities, Fabriken Furillen is a rural outlier on the island of Gotland, off Sweden's southeastern coast. Once a limestone refinery, the 18-room hotel (including two cabins) is a haven of sharp-edged Scandinavian design in a stunningly scenic -- almost lunar -- setting.</p>  <p>Rooms are painted in white or gray and feature luxury beds, Bang & Olufsen technology (some rooms have televisions, others have radios; the cabins are electronics-free) and bucolic touches like sheepskin rugs and blankets made from Gotland wool. The restaurant serves simple, elegant meals made with island-grown vegetables and herbs. Rooms start at $315; Rute Furillen, 624 58 Lärbro; 46-498/223-040; furillen.com .</p>  <p>Top U.S. spots to visit in 2014</p>  <p>Wythe Hotel, Brooklyn, New York</p>  <p>Brooklyn is home to plenty of reclaimed industrial spaces, but the Wythe Hotel is one of the newest (it opened in May 2012) and chicest. Floor-to-ceiling windows in many rooms look straight out onto the Manhattan skyline over the East River, letting in copious amounts of sunlight to play off the exposed-brick walls and custom-made wallpaper.</p>  <p>Original cast-iron columns, masonry and 13-foot-high timber ceilings speak to the building's history as a cooperage. The concrete floors are heated (a detail the former tenants might have appreciated as they rolled out barrels on the Williamsburg waterfront); the furniture (beds were constructed from pine taken from the ceilings) and artwork is made locally. Rooms start at $180; 80 Wythe Ave.; 718-460-8000; wythehotel.com .</p>  <p>Refinery Hotel, New York</p>  <p>A century-old neo-Gothic building in the heart of New York's Garment District, the Refinery started out as a millinery factory. It is now an elegant, eclectic 12-story hotel with amazing structural features and plenty of luxurious amenities. Opened in May 2013, it features lobby details (a 72-foot custom-designed runner, vaulted ceilings, plaid-patterened finished-walnut walls) that evoke an old New York feel.</p>  <p>In the rooms, steel-and-leather headboards reinforce the industrial ambiance, while wooden bedside lockers add a touch of nostalgia. On occasion the hotel's loading dock becomes Hatbox, a gallery space hosting art exhibits and fashion shows. Rooms start at $460; 63 W. 38th St.; 646-664-0310; refineryhotelnewyork.com .</p>  <p>Departures: World's best design hotels</p>  <p>Sir Albert, Amsterdam</p>  <p>Though Sir Albert may have a fictional host at its helm (the gentleman of its name is a made-up character), the hotel has a very real former life as a 19th-century diamond factory. Despite the space's original connection to gems, the decor has a distinctly masculine feel, thanks to brown curtains, dark wood furniture in the guest rooms and cowskin-patterned cubes for sitting in the study -- a cozy public space with deep leather armchairs and well-stocked bookshelves.</p>  <p>Plenty of bright northern sunshine streams in through the high windows in most rooms, which harkens back to the legacy of the diamond workers, who needed the best possible light to practice their craft. Rooms start at $270; Albert Cuypstraat 2-6; 31-20/305-3020; siralberthotel.com .</p>  <p>Departures: High-design airport terminals</p>  <p>Waterhouse, Shanghai</p>  <p>Formerly a dockyard warehouse on the Huangpu River, Waterhouse is now a high-design hotel. While plenty of its earliest features have been preserved -- the window frames are original metal and the wall behind the reception desk looks positively ancient -- the refurbished concept (by the lavishly praised Neri & Hu Design and Research Office) is a modern masterpiece.</p>  <p>Playing with conventions of internal and external spaces, the design allows guests to peek into private quarters from public areas and vice versa. Gloriously sleek and minimalist, the 19 rooms contrast nicely with views onto the neon-lit Bund, which is crammed with unconventionally shaped skyscrapers. Rooms start at $195; Maojiayuan Road 1-3, Huangpu District; 86-21/6080-2988; waterhouseshanghai.com .</p>  <p>Departures: Spectacular casino hotels</p>  <p>Shangri-La Bosphorus, Istanbul</p>  <p>Originally a tobacco warehouse in the 1930s, this Shangri-La property opened in May 2013 with the largest guestrooms in Istanbul. Situated on the European side of the city, with many rooms overlooking the Bosphorus Strait, the hotel pays homage to the opulence of its Bosphorus neighbor, Dolmabahçe Palace.</p>  <p>Chandeliers glitter, specially commissioned artwork dazzles, and Turkish-marble bathrooms come stocked with Bulgari bath products. The hotel's architects even restored the Neoclassical façade of the original warehouse. For unparalleled views, check out the Shangri-La Suite, which has three private terraces and overlooks the Old City (the Asian bank of the strait) and the Bosphorus Bridge.

You almost have to see the sprawling estate to believe that the lifestyle existed, yet the trip to visit Highclere Castle , the estate used by the television show in rural England, may cost more than the less well-to-do American can afford.</p>  <p>There's no need to cross the pond to get a taste of that life. Although the United States did not have lords or ladies living on grand estates, there were American millionaires who made their fortunes by harnessing the resources of a new country. With an eye to the style of their European counterparts, they built mansions on extensive grounds to show off their power and wealth. So if you're entering a period of ""Downton"" withdrawal, consider a peek into America's historic high life.</p>  <p>The places where masterpieces are born</p>  <p>""These homes represented the creation of immense wealth at the turn of the century in the United States, the kind of wealth acquired through fundamental commodities like water, gold, oil and food,"" said Katherine Malone-France, the National Trust for Historic Preservation's historic sites director of outreach, education and support.</p>  <p>""These estates represented the taste and sophistication of their owners, as well as the skills and labors of those who built them and worked in them. These places were icons then and now, and they make for great television and fantastic places to visit as historic sites, because they contain all of those complex, compelling and interwoven stories.""</p>  <p>The new American wealthy didn't have hundreds of years to build their fancy homes and reputations, yet the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and other wealthy families built houses to last for generations. These are just a handful of the homes where they were living large around the same time as the ""Downton Abbey"" story lines.</p>  <p>Downton Abbey creates tourism boom</p>  <p>The Rockefellers: Hudson Valley, New York</p>  <p>With the economic engine that is New York nearby, it makes sense that the country's new wealthy would build their homes and country homes in the city's suburbs and nearby Hudson Valley. The Vanderbilts, Roosevelts and Goulds all had homes in the area.</p>  <p>Completed in 1913, Kykuit was the home of Standard Oil founder and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller and the next three generations of his family. The six-story home, now a National Trust for Historic Preservation property operated by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, is open to the public for tours.</p>  <p>Make sure to tour the gardens to see New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's 20th-century sculpture collection, including the works of Alexander Calder, Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. Kykuit's elaborate gardens also feature classical sculpture, pavilions, fountains and Hudson River views.</p>  <p>The Douglas family: Cedar Rapids, Iowa</p>  <p>Like the fictional Crawleys, the Douglas family was touched by the sinking of the Titanic.</p>  <p>Although the Brucemore estate was built for wealthy widow Caroline Sinclair and her six children in 1886, the Sinclair family lived there just 20 years. The George and Irene Douglas family and its descendants, known for Douglas & Co. and Quaker Oats, lived there from 1906 to 1981.</p>  <p>It was George's brother Walter who perished on the Titanic. Reports say his wife, Mahala, asked him to join her on a lifeboat. He replied, ""No, I must be a gentleman"" and went to join a group of men waiting for later lifeboats. His body was recovered later and identified by his monogrammed shirt.</p>  <p>Visitors can tour the 21-room Queen Anne style mansion and grounds.</p>  <p>The Booths: Bloomfield Hills, Michigan</p>  <p>The Canadian-born owner of an ironworks company, George Booth settled in Detroit when he married Ellen Warren Scripps, the daughter of the founder of the Detroit News. The Booths purchased a rundown farm in Bloomfield Hills to turn into their summer home and eventually built a new year-round home, Cranbrook House , which was completed in 1908.</p>  <p>George Booth became a leading patron of the American Arts and Crafts movement in the early 20th century, and it showed in the designs he chose for his home and the art he collected. The couple also started six education and arts institutions on their property, including the famous Cranbrook Academy of Art.</p>  <p>While still alive, they deeded the house, much of its contents and the surrounding property to the Cranbrook Foundation they created, living the rest of their lives not as owners but under a life trust at Cranbrook House. It is the oldest surviving manor home in the metro Detroit area.</p>  <p>The Vanderbilts: Asheville, North Carolina</p>  <p>George Vanderbilt didn't care for the city life as much as the rest of his family. So it was no surprise that after he visited the mountains of North Carolina, he eventually built his 250-room estate in Asheville. The Biltmore was completed in 1895, when he was still single. Vanderbilt married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in Paris in 1898, and the couple raised their only child at Biltmore.</p>  <p>Descendants of the Vanderbilts still own and operate the estate as a for-profit company, and the home is now open to the public for tours. There's a 10,000-volume library, a bowling alley, a banquet hall featuring a 70-foot ceiling, an indoor pool and the artwork of Pierre Auguste Renoir and John Singer Sargent, among others.</p>  <p>Architect Richard Morris Hunt modeled the house after three 16th-century French chateaux. With more than 30 bedrooms, it's still shy of the 50 plus bedrooms at Downton's Highclere Castle. Still, Biltmore seems more than adequate for a house party.</p>  <p>Don't miss the butler's tour if you want to see how the other half lived on the estate. Modern guests can stay at an inn built in 2001 or a historic cottage that once served as the gardener's house.</p>  <p>The Bourns: Woodsid e , California</p>  <p>Filoli was completed in 1917 as the country estate for Mr. and Mrs. William Bowers Bourn, San Franciscans whose money came from water and gold. Filoli is just 30 miles outside San Francisco.</p>  <p>The European influence can be found all over the property: Tuscan columns in the portico, art from the Bourns' travels to Europe and even some of the house's walls. (The house library was copied from the library at Denham Place, a 1690s home in England.)</p>  <p>The expansive formal gardens were designed and constructed between 1917 and 1929. The next owners lived in the house until 1975, when the house and formal gardens were donated to the National Trust for Historic Preservation.</p>  <p>The Berwinds: Newport, Rhode Island</p>  <p>Downton fans might remember that the mother of American-born Cora, the countess of Grantham, had a home in Newport. That's where rich Americans summered, and it's where visitors can tour several grand homes at a time.</p>  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Edward Julius Berwind, who made their money in coal mining, built the Elms as their summer residence in Newport. Now one of the famous Newport Mansions and a National Historic Landmark, the Elms was finished in 1901. Unlike some residents of fictional Downton, who grudgingly adapted to modern conveniences like telephones and electricity, the Berwinds had the Elms outfitted with the latest modern conveniences. The house was among the first in Newport to be fully electrified with no gas backup. There was even an early ice maker.</p>  <p>The couple's art collection featured 18th-century Venetian and French paintings and Renaissance ceramics.</p>  <p>To get a good sense of life among the servants, the Preservation Society of Newport County, which owns and operates 10 historic properties in Newport, added an Elms servant life tour last year.</p> "

It was all about stealth. Pentagon Cold War strategists desperately wanted to build planes that could evade Soviet radar.</p>  <p>And so the Air Force launched a ""black program"" to develop Tacit Blue and tested it at a secret government airbase in Nevada called ""Area 51,"" according to CIA documents released in 2013 .</p>  <p>The program, which lasted from 1978 to 1985, aimed to develop a single-seater jet for battlefield surveillance.</p>  <p>Before last year's document release, the government never acknowledged the existence of Area 51. For decades, a fenced-off area surrounding Nevada's Groom Lake was rumored to be a testing ground for some of the nation's most secret technology.</p>  <p>Two retired Air Force test pilots who flew Tacit Blue in the early 1980s, Ken Dyson and Russ Easter, spoke about why this plane was important and what set it apart.</p>  <p>Although the plane flew 135 times and was never put into production, without Tacit Blue, there would have been no B-2 Spirit bomber. The plane proved that aircraft with curved surfaces could evade radar.</p>  <p>""The airplane flew pretty solid, I'd say,"" Dyson remembered.</p>  <p>Could sightings of Tacit Blue have contributed to UFO reports?</p>  <p>""I'm not aware of any circumstance like that,"" Easter said. Dyson also says no.</p>  <p>But Cynda Thomas, widow of the first Tacit Blue test pilot Richard G. ""Dick"" Thomas, said she was with her husband in Los Angeles when an airline pilot accosted her husband during a test pilots' banquet at the Beverly Hilton.</p>  <p>As she remembers it, ""The pilot came over, and he said, 'Mr. Thomas, I'm so-and-so, and I fly for Continental, and I'm sure I saw you flying the Tacit Blue -- and you know, I reported you as a UFO.' ""</p>  <p>""Airline pilots have, over the past, reported some stuff that could have been black aircraft in flight tests,"" Dyson said.</p>  <p>""One and a half"" Tacit Blue planes were built, Dyson said, so that ""if we lost one, we could have a second one up and flying in short order."" What happened to the other half of Tacit Blue? ""I think it was done away with -- with total respect to secrecy.""</p>  <p>Mechanical remnants from a related black program called Have Blue ""are buried at Groom Lake,"" according to a 2011 Air Force report . Groom Lake is inside Area 51, according to those released CIA documents .</p>  <p>""I don't know anything at all about that Have Blue stuff and wouldn't answer it if I did,"" said Dyson, who also tested Have Blue airplanes.</p>  <p>Dyson is aware of the CIA documents but said he didn't want to talk about Groom Lake or Area 51 or to even mention those places by name. ""That's just because of the secrecy that was drilled into me,"" he said.</p>  <p>Maintaining Tacit Blue's secrets and preventing leaks, Dyson said, was proof of the success of a tightly knit and dedicated team. Pursuing a career centered around a secret job takes discipline.</p>  <p>""My wife had no clue what I was doing for a long time,"" Dyson said. ""I just didn't talk about it to her or to anyone else who wasn't cleared on the program. It just wasn't done.""</p>  <p>Richard Thomas also kept details about his work from his family, Cynda Thomas said, although in 1978 he did reveal to her that he was ""going into the black world.""</p>  <p>Secrecy made professional relationships complicated at times. Associates outside Dyson's and Easter's secret circle wanted to hear ""war stories"" about what it was like to work in the world of black programs, Easter said. ""Sometimes I wish we could tell more stories more freely so that some of the lessons learned could be passed on freer.""</p>  <p>50 states, 50 spots to visit in 2014</p>  <p>Three unique things about Tacit Blue</p>  <p>• Pantyhose made it safer: According to Cynda Thomas' book ""Hell of a Ride,"" an air compressor was blowing tiny flammable aluminum shavings through inlet pipes and into the cockpit, creating a fire hazard. The engineers' unorthodox solution: cover the inlet pipes with filters made of pantyhose, Thomas wrote. ""That could be true,"" Easter acknowledges.</p>  <p>• They created an artificial wind tunnel with a huge transport aircraft. Developers used a huge C-130 Hercules plane to create artificial winds that hit the side of the plane so they could test Tacit Blue's performance. Dyson described it as a sort of ""wind tunnel"" that was set up ""in the black of the night so no one could see us flying overhead with a satellite.""</p>  <p>• It was very hard to pilot: Tacit Blue at the time was ""arguably the most unstable aircraft man had ever flown,"" ex-Northrop engineer John Cashen told Air Force Magazine .</p>  <p>Richard Thomas died in 2006, at age 76. Cynda Thomas said her husband had been battling Parkinson's disease.</p>  <p>At Tacit Blue's 1996 unveiling ceremony at the museum, Thomas was able to sit inside the airplane's cockpit one more time.</p>  <p>""That's when they let me point my camera up the steps of the airplane to take his picture,"" recalls Cynda Thomas. ""I'm so thankful he got to do that before he passed. That plane was my husband's legacy.""</p>  <p>8 very old sites in the New World</p>  <p>The plane that wouldn't quit: 'Spare 617'</p>  <p>Outside the museum's doors, at the Air Park, sit several giant planes -- each with their own stories. One of them, the Air Force Museum says, saw ""one of the greatest feats of airmanship of the Southeast Asia War.""</p>  <p>In April 1972, a huge C130-E Hercules transport plane code-named Spare 617 was ordered to fly over a raging battle in South Vietnam and parachute-drop giant pallets of ammunition. If all went well, the ammo would resupply South Vietnamese soldiers fighting on the ground. But all did not go well.</p>  <p>Preparing to make his drop, pilot William Caldwell flew the plane low over the town of An Loc.</p>  <p>But the enemy had put a machine gun nest high above the town in a church steeple, Caldwell recalled. ""So, we were just a sitting duck for him.""</p>  <p>Caldwell remembers machine gun fire ripping through the cockpit, smashing a circuit breaker panel and the plane's windows. Flight engineer Jon Sanders died instantly. The attack wounded copilot John Hering and navigator Richard Lenz and damaged two of the plane's four turboprop engines.</p>  <p>Gunfire ruptured a duct designed to bleed hot air from the plane's powerful engines. The scalding air severely burned cargo loadmaster Charlie Shaub, as Caldwell put it, like a ""600-degree hurricane.""</p>  <p>Then it got worse. The attack set fire to some of the plane's explosive cargo.</p>  <p>But despite his burns, Shaub was somehow able to eject the burning pallets of ammunition. It was just in time. Seconds later, the ammo exploded as it fell to the ground. Then, Shaub astonishingly snuffed out the fire in the cargo hold. Caldwell closed the bleed air duct and shut down the damaged engines.</p>  <p>Next problem: how to save the wounded crew. Caldwell pointed the plane toward an air base with the best medical facilities. He would have to land a giant C-130E with only two working engines -- both on the same side of the aircraft.</p>  <p>Things looked grim, he said, but ""I got more confident with every mile we got closer to the air base,"" said Caldwell.</p>  <p>Again, things went further south.</p>  <p>A hydraulics system that was needed to lower the landing gear became useless. Using nothing but sheer muscle, Lenz and cargo loadmaster Dave McAleece lowered the wheels by hand using crank handles, Caldwell said.</p>  <p>Caldwell landed the plane fast: pushing about 170 mph. With hydraulics busted, he had trouble steering the plane.</p>  <p>""I used the inboard right side engine to guide the plane down a high-speed runway turnoff,"" he said.</p>  <p>After rolling to a stop, ""I got out of the airplane,"" Caldwell recalled. An airman on the ground asked, ""Are you OK?"" Caldwell replied, ""You bastards didn't prepare us for THIS.""</p>  <p>Blood Falls and other natural oddities</p>  <p>Three notable details about the mission</p>  <p>• What recognition did the crew receive? Caldwell and Shaub received the Air Force Cross, the Air Force's second-highest award for valor.</p>  <p>• Did the plane have any weapons? Spare 617 flew with virtually no defensive weaponry. ""We only had .38 revolvers,"" said Caldwell, 70, now a retired colonel who teaches aviation management at Southern Illinois University. It was the airplane itself, he said, that helped save them. ""That airplane was just as responsible for getting us home as any of the crew.""</p>  <p>• How hard was it to lower the landing gear? The attack knocked out the plane's hydraulic system, forcing the crew to lower the plane's gigantic landing gear manually. ""I think it takes roughly 650 turns of that crank to get a landing gear down on both sides of the airplane. It's an endurance thing more than strength thing.""</p>  <p>'Angel' of freedom: The Hanoi Taxi</p>  <p>A third piece of flying history at the museum has come to symbolize freedom for former U.S. POWs captured during the Vietnam War.</p>  <p>They call it the Hanoi Taxi, the first U.S. plane to ferry newly freed troops out of North Vietnam. Photos of the ex-captives taken aboard the C-141 Starlifter clearly illustrate the joy and relief the men felt that day in February 1973.</p>  <p>Until the POWs left enemy airspace, they had refused to give their captors the satisfaction of showing happiness for being released. When they crossed over international waters, stoic silence immediately turned to joyful pandemonium.</p>  <p>A few hours later, with the Starlifter in the background, TV viewers watched stunning, emotional reunions in the Philippines between the ex-POWs and their loved ones.</p>  <p>Maj. Gen. Edward Mechenbier , a retired Air Force fighter pilot who spent nearly six years as a North Vietnamese prisoner, rode aboard the plane as it carried him back to the United States from the Philippines.</p>  <p>""This plane looked like an absolute angel coming to get us,"" he remembered.</p>  <p>Now, the plane sits at the museum's Air Park, at the mercy of the wind and cold. Walking around the aircraft and running your hand across its metal exterior, you get a sense that you're touching a piece of history.</p>  <p>""It's a hallowed place,"" said museum curator Jeff Duford. ""And you can definitely get a sense of that when you step aboard it."" But right now, that's not possible for visitors. The Taxi's interior is off-limits, and its flight deck windows are covered.</p>  <p>The plane -- along with Spare 617 -- is slated to be housed in a new $35.4 million building in 2016. Duford says the museum hasn't decided whether visitors will be able to board either aircraft when they move inside.</p>  <p>The Hanoi Taxi flew two freedom missions carrying ex-POWs out of Hanoi's Gia Lam Airport. Overall, the aircraft's total passengers to freedom numbered 78 POWs and two civilian returnees. The plane also flew four freedom missions from the Philippines to the United States, carrying a total of 76 ex-POWs.</p>  <p>For four decades, the airplane served around the world, until it retired in 2006 to the Air Force museum.</p>  <p>Three unique things about the Hanoi Taxi</p>  <p>• The plane returned to Vietnam in 2004: Mechenbier, by then a major general, flew the Hanoi Taxi back to Vietnam on a mission to repatriate the newly recovered remains of two U.S. service members who were killed in action during the war.</p>  <p>• It served in the Iraq War: The plane helped transfer wounded troops from Baghdad to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and to Washington for treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</p>  <p>• It served as a disaster evacuation plane: The Hanoi Taxi airlifted survivors to safety after 2005's Hurricane Katrina.</p>  <p>Like many of the museum's other hundreds of aircraft, these three planes -- Tacit Blue, Spare 617 and the Hanoi Taxi -- contributed to history.</p>  <p>""These really aren't airplanes anymore,"" Duford said. ""They're artifacts. And so we want to make sure, as a responsible institution, that we protect those artifacts. That's more important than anything else.""</p> "
"216","Jets born in mammoth building","CNN.com","2014-03-05 13:43:58","2014-10-06 05:57:44","http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/26/travel/boeing-aviation-geek-factory-tour/index.html","Travel"," <p>""Let's go see some airplanes!"" says our Boeing VIP tour guide.</p>  <p>I remind myself: This doesn't happen very often.</p>  <p>Yeah yeah yeah, Boeing offers public tours of this 98.3-acre airliner factory north of Seattle every day. This ain't that. This is special.</p>  <p>As part of a convention of aviation fans called Aviation Geek Fest , we're gaining ultra-exclusive access to the factory FLOOR. The public tour is limited to the balcony. We're about to walk knee-deep where Boeing gives birth to some of the world's biggest and most advanced airliners, including the 747-8 Intercontinental, the 777 Worldliner and the 787 Dreamliner.</p>  <p>Hot damn.</p>  <p>But not so fast -- before we go inside, Boeing has laid down some rules: no photos, no video, for our eyes only.</p>  <p>Here's a painful development: Our smartphones have been confiscated. Gulp. I'm already suffering from phantom phone pangs.</p>  <p>We enter through a small, inconspicuous door marked S-1. Suddenly, we're surrounded by partly assembled airliners in a room so big it takes on the feeling of an entire world. In some spots, we gaze across an unobstructed view measuring a quarter-mile.</p>  <p>This building is so flippin' big that -- years ago -- it created its own inside weather patterns, including vapor clouds. They eliminated that by installing a special ventilation system. Today's factory forecast: avgeeking, with continued avgeeking and a favorable chance of avgeeking later in the day.</p>  <p>Here are a few cool tidbits:</p>  <p>Jaw - dropping perspective</p>  <p>The thrill of being so close to the planes literally stops you in your tracks. Seemingly everywhere you look there's another five- or six-story-tall airplane towering over you. Some are covered with a green, protective temporary coating. One Dreamliner tail is painted with the familiar British Airways red, white and blue. Another sports New Zealand Air's cool black-and-white.</p>  <p>Boeing paints the tails before they're attached to the planes. Then they carefully adjust the tails for balance. Paint adds hundreds of pounds of weight, which would ruin the plane's balance if the tails were painted after being attached.</p>  <p>Soon these behemoths will jet across vast oceans as they carry travelers to far-flung destinations.</p>  <p>'You've gotta have secret clearance'</p>  <p>The planes' huge fuselages are joined together with the help of a giant piece of equipment called a ""saddle."" This U-shaped metal cage straddles the top of the planes during the body-joining process.</p>  <p>The ""Wing Build"" area -- where workers attach wings to the planes -- is the loudest part of the entire facility. The staccato of rivet guns pierces the heavy air. Whooshing vacuums suck up any dust that may be created when workers drill into the planes' lightweight carbon composite material.</p>  <p>Security concerns in the plant are real. ""Conversation-restricted area,"" says one sign.</p>  <p>As we walk past a fenced-off zone, our guide quips, ""You've gotta have secret clearance. I can't even go in there!""</p>  <p>The rock star engine</p>  <p>Then, like a holy relic brought back from the Crusades -- Boeing lets us touch ""it.""</p>  <p>By ""it"" we mean the GE90-115B . Guinness calls it the most powerful commercially produced jet engine in the world.</p>  <p>We gather around this rock star engine like thirsty travelers at a desert oasis, each taking turns running our hands across its silver exterior. The lip of the engine's mouth feels rough, like it has countless scratches etched into it. That design, engineers discovered, helps reduce noise.</p>  <p>This 19,000-pound monster hangs from the wing of a giant 777, but the engine still looks humongous -- measuring more than 11 feet in diameter. In fact, Boeing says it's so big you could fit the body of a 737 airliner inside it.</p>  <p>""There's no way to sense the sheer size of an airplane without being right there underneath it,"" says NYCAviation.com contributor Ben Granucci , enjoying his first Aviation Geek Fest. Engines like this make it possible for wide-body planes to fly long-distance routes nonstop with only two engines instead of three or four. In fact, the 777 flies many of the world's longest nonstop routes. In 2005 it set the world distance record for a nonstop commercial airline flight, jetting 13,423 miles from Hong Kong eastbound to London in 22 hours, 22 minutes.</p>  <p>The world's top flying haule r</p>  <p>Just a few hours earlier, a handful of aviation geeks were hanging out at a hotel next to Paine Field, the airport Boeing uses to test and deliver the factory's planes.</p>  <p>Then, Granucci tweeted out that the plane that hauls the most cargo by volume in the world just happened to be passing through.</p>  <p>Count me in.</p>  <p>Soon, a dozen camera-wielding geeks are lined up outside the hotel to welcome the Dreamlifter -- a modified 747 -- as it lumbers in for a landing. ""We're gonna be late for breakfast,"" says avgeek Steve Dillo as he snaps photo after photo. ""But this is worth it.""</p>  <p>The thing roars like a lion, but it looks like a whale as it slows for touchdown. In the entire world, there are only four of these giant planes. Boeing uses them to ferry big sections of the 787 for final assembly here in Everett. Last year, when a Dreamlifter landed at the wrong airport in Kansas , it wasn't exactly a stellar moment.</p>  <p>The Avgeek News Network</p>  <p>This is the fifth avgeek fest, co-sponsored by AirlineReporter.com and Everett's Future of Flight Museum . The February convention drew a record 300-plus participants from 18 different states and three countries. Former GM and Toyota engineer Philip McKenzie, flew 8,000 miles from Melbourne, Australia, to see how ""things are laid out"" in the factory. Vancouver Airport official Trevor Batstone traveled 100 miles from Canada. Who are these people -- these avgeeks? What defines them?</p>  <p>""It's someone who always looks up in the sky when they hear a jet roar,"" says Ryan Ewing, 14, who runs airlinegeeks.com out of his Bethesda, Maryland, home. Ewing was right there in the thick of the geeks with his camera when the Dreamlifter came calling.</p>  <p>The event was born from an aviation-obsessed online community that uses social media to organize and share information. Aviation news sites like Airchive , AirlineReporter, NYCAviation and AirlineGuys all share common friends, connections and interests. When news breaks, their informal social network sometimes challenges traditional news media. This month AirlineReporter and a few other aviation sites broke news about the hijacking of an Ethiopian Airlines 767 in Rome about 30 minutes before many ""legacy"" news organizations, says AirlineReporter founder and editor-in-chief David Parker Brown .</p>  <p>Boeing's desire to connect with fans and fliers combined with the emerging power of the avgeek nation opened the doors to the exclusive Boeing tours, Brown says. ""Boeing has increasingly realized how smart and educated about aviation avgeeks are.""</p>  <p>Baby Boeings</p>  <p>The following day southeast of Seattle, Boeing opens up yet another factory for us to tour. This one is the birthplace of what Guinness calls the ""most produced large commercial jet in aviation history"" -- the 737.</p>  <p>No public tours here. This is a tour for avgeeks and VIPs. ""Avgeeks love getting access to places that are off limits,"" says Brown. ""It's all about exclusivity.""</p>  <p>Here's some 737 tour trivia:</p>  <p>—This place creates 38 of the planes every month on a moving assembly line. And they're pushing to increase that rate. ""Even though we joke that the 737 is the 'Baby Boeing,' it's still a large and complex machine,"" says Granucci. ""It requires precision to put it together. The fact that you can perform such precise work on a moving target -- I find that to be incredible.""</p>  <p>— The facility receives pre-assembled fuselages by train from a factory in Wichita, Kansas.</p>  <p>— Workers attach wings to the fuselages. It takes about nine hours to put wings on a 737.</p>  <p>—The planes also get ""winglets"" — the tiny, upward pointing wings you see on the wingtips of 737s and other airliners. These doodads reduce drag on the plane and make it more fuel efficient — by about 4%.</p>  <p>—Workers install seats on the planes by using a loading machine they call a ""hay baler.""</p>  <p>— In an operation called ""high blow,"" Boeing tests each plane's passenger cabin for possible leaks during pressurization. The procedure includes putting people inside the planes to listen for leaks.</p>  <p>— Each 737 is made up of 42 miles of wire and 394,000 separate parts</p>  <p>— If there's a problem on the assembly line, workers activate a purple flashing light -- alerting others that they need help. ""Blinking purple is bad for us here,"" says Christian Ofsthus, a Boeing senior manager. ""If there's something wrong, something doesn't fit, we need to do something about that.""</p>  <p>As the tour ends, we wind through an employee diner named for the World War II symbol Rosie the Riveter, and file back onto our bus. Driving off the property, we spot a train loaded with brand new wingless 737 fuselages headed to the factory behind us.</p>  <p>That triggers spontaneous applause and scattered whoops throughout the bus. Well, you just can't get any geekier than that.</p>  <p>""That is so cool,"" I hear someone say.</p>  <p>""Yeah,"" said someone else, ""baby planes!""</p> "

""This plane was a part of my life,"" said Lyon, 77. ""I saw it being built. I saw it being put together.""</p>  <p>Unfortunately, negotiations have hit a snag. More on that in a minute. First, you gotta know about the amazing story surrounding the plane and the man who flew it.</p>  <p>Its official name was the H-4. Hughes called it the Hercules. Designed to carry more than 700 troops, the Spruce Goose flew only once. In 1947 in Long Beach harbor, it grabbed about 70 feet of air for about a mile. Hughes — who piloted the test flight — said it needed more development. He never let it fly again.</p>  <p>Was the flight a failure, as some newspapers suggested? Depends on who you ask. Hughes did prove the thing could fly. But it was never officially certified. Lawmakers hauled Hughes before a congressional committee to justify the plane's taxpayer price tag of $22 million. Hughes pointed out that he had spent an additional $18 million of his own funds to develop the plane.</p>  <p>Fearless rogue pilo t</p>  <p>When Lyon met Hughes, it wasn't the OCD-plagued, naked, bearded recluse portrayed near the end of Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator."" This was before that.</p>  <p>This was a younger Hughes -- the seemingly fearless, rogue pilot and entrepreneur who was hell-bent on success for his aircraft manufacturing company.</p>  <p>Lyon was then 10 years old. Hughes seemed like a likable person when they met at the office of Lyon's father -- who was Hughes' patent lawyer. ""I'd never seen a tall, lanky, guy with a Texas accent before,"" he remembers. ""I grew up in Southern California.""</p>  <p>In July 1946, the young Lyon had a more memorable brush with the man when Hughes crashed a prototype reconnaissance plane a block away from his parents' Beverly Hills home.</p>  <p>The boy arrived at the crash scene to see a fire, a huge column of black smoke and what was left of three damaged houses. No one was killed, but Lyon saw an ambulance driver help transport a seriously injured victim. ""That turned out to be Howard Hughes,"" he said.</p>  <p>Soon, other neighborhood kids descended on the scene and started grabbing small pieces of wreckage and running off with them as souvenirs. Lyon remembers police canvassing the neighborhood looking for the missing debris.</p>  <p>""My brother and I were upstairs and my mother went to the front door and there were two officers from the Beverly Hills police department asking, 'Do you have any young children in this house?' She yelled upstairs to us, saying, 'Do you have some pieces of that airplane?' We said, 'No!' And she said, 'Yes, I think you do! Bring them down here! The police are here and they want them.' So we pulled this piece of metal out from underneath my brother's bed and took it downstairs,"" Lyon recalled with a chuckle. ""We thought that was highly unfair.""</p>  <p>That same year Lyon watched trucks roll the Spruce Goose down local streets from the plane's construction site on Los Angeles' west side to Long Beach. They ""cut telephone and power lines to get this huge thing down the road.""</p>  <p>Hughes died in 1976 at age 70, and by the early 1980s the Spruce Goose was forced to move out of its giant Long Beach hangar. The plane's owners -- including Hughes' Summa Corp. and the U.S. government -- gave the plane to the Aero Club. The transfer forestalled tax expenses and the prospect of cutting the plane into pieces for display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington.</p>  <p>""The Aero Club's mission in this whole thing was to save the Spruce Goose,"" said Lyon.</p>  <p>The club leased the plane to a company as a tourist attraction. Spruce Goose was moved a short distance away to a spectacular seaside dome next to the moored luxury liner Queen Mary. Around that time, during a celebration dinner, Lyon arrived late to what was supposed to be an escorted tour of the plane. He took the liberty of exploring it alone. Lyon, who also has an engineering degree and a pilot's license, said it was like being a ""kid in a candy store.""</p>  <p>He wandered inside one of the aircraft's gigantic wings, amazed at the plane's engineering. He climbed up a set of stairs into the cockpit, daring to sit in the pilot seat where Hughes flew the plane in 1947. ""I noted that there were controls for the pilot, but none for the co-pilot,"" Lyon said with a chuckle. ""Yeah, Howard was gonna fly it. He didn't need any help.""</p>  <p>Eventually the Spruce Goose had to leave the dome. That's when Aero Club struck a bargain with Evergreen and the behemoth was floated up the West Coast on barges in a spectacular 138-day moving operation to Oregon.</p>  <p>Now, Lyon is piloting Aero Club's negotiations for the plane's final payment. The dispute, said Lyon, basically comes down to a payment formula and the interpretation of three words: justifiable operating expense.</p>  <p>""It's a problem of contract interpretation,"" Lyon said.</p>  <p>News media reports have overstated the negotiations' worst-case scenario, he explained. ""We're not interested in repossessing it. It would be a nightmare.""</p>  <p>For its part, the museum agrees with Lyon. ""... both sides expect a prompt resolution of that payment,"" the museum said in a statement. Although the museum declined CNN's requests for an interview, the museum's statement said the facility remains open, is financially viable and has no plans to close.</p>  <p>Bottom line: museum-goers -- which number around 150,000 a year -- have nothing to fear, Lyon said. ""The Spruce Goose is going to stay where it is.""</p>  <p>""The museum is no danger of losing the Spruce Goose,"" echoed Evergreen spokeswoman Melissa Grace in a statement. ""It will stay at its home at the museum for visitors to enjoy for years to come.""</p>  <p>But the museum faces another financial issue.</p>  <p>For months the Evergreen museum, and a related organization called the Captain Michael Smith Educational Institute, have been part of an investigation by Oregon's Justice Department. Agency spokesman Michael Kron said the investigation was sparked by ""people who were concerned about financial transactions by Evergreen.""</p>  <p>The museum owner holds companies that are for-profit and some that are nonprofit. There have been allegations of improper transfer of funds between the two types of companies . The museum said it is independent, self-sufficient and nonprofit.</p>  <p>Kron describes the probe as a ""charitable activities investigation into the charity that runs the museum.""</p>  <p>Recently, a broker listed two of the museum's plane exhibits -- a 1945 Grumman Avenger for $250,000 and a 1928 Ford Tri-Motor — for $1.75 million.</p>  <p>It's unknown if the museum's decision to sell the planes is linked to its financial issues. ""The vast majority"" of the museum's aircraft exhibits, it said, ""are unaffected by issues"" linked to the investigation. Evergreen said most of the planes on display at the museum are on loan from some of the best aviation museums in the world, including the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force , the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum and the National Naval Aviation Museum .</p>  <p>The museum says it's ""in no danger of losing its displays from these and other sources"" and it has ""cooperated with the Department of Justice in its review and that we are confident the Department of Justice would acknowledge our cooperation and the good work we have put into addressing concerns it has raised.""</p>  <p>Kron said a final investigation report is expected to be made public soon.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Lyon is nearing the finish line as a custodian of this aviation icon. During the two decades since the Spruce Goose deal was struck, he's never traveled to Oregon to see the plane.</p>  <p>But, he said, who knows? When it's all said and done, he may fly up for a visit.</p> "

Think again","CNN.com","2014-04-14 15:49:56","2014-10-06 05:57:49","http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/14/travel/irpt-library-fascination-travel/index.html","Travel"," <p>Little did he know that stepping into Seattle's Central Library would spark his curiosity. The library's geometric glass and steel interior with its sprawling ""books spiral"" grabbed ahold of him.</p>  <p>""It's just an incredible building,"" he said, still remembering his awe during that 2013 trip. ""I spent an hour and a half just taking pictures, and while doing that, I was getting the idea that I should visit other libraries.""</p>  <p>This past year, Nagel has traveled to 12 libraries across the United States, photographing their shelves and hallways like an explorer. He's one of many people discovering a renewed fascination with libraries. He and other iReporters shared photos of libraries they visited with CNN iReport for National Library Week , observed April 13-19 this year.</p>  <p>Despite the expansive digitalization of information, the use of public libraries remains popular, according to Cathy De Rosa, vice president for the Americas and global vice president of marketing at OCLC, a nonprofit computer library service organization .</p>  <p>""It surprises people,"" she said, explaining there's a presumption amongst the public that libraries are becoming increasingly irrelevant.</p>  <p>But despite enduring budget cutbacks and being forced to reinvent their services in the face of the ubiquitous Internet, public libraries remain staple institutions in various communities. There's been an increase in the use of public libraries in the U.S. over the past decade. Services such as public computers doubled in usage in the past 10 years, and libraries saw a circulation increase of 2.46 billion materials in 2010, the highest ever reported, according to a report by the Institute of Museum and Library Services .</p>  <p>Some libraries bring in more than just patrons. They are also popular amongst tourists, drawing visitors by the tens of thousands, if not millions.</p>  <p>The Seattle Public Library system, for example, attracts more than 7 million people through its doors each year. ""The Central Library is one of the most beautiful modern buildings in Seattle, and it really celebrates the people,"" said Andra Addison, a spokesperson for the library.</p>  <p>Smaller libraries matter, too</p>  <p>Americans strongly value the role of public libraries in their community, according to findings by the Pew Research Center . In fact, 94% of people polled in 2013 said that having a public library improves the quality of life in a community.</p>  <p>Jennifer Roberts , a writing teacher, agrees. She spent many summer days with her daughters, Lucy and Miriam, visiting their local library in Grants Pass, Oregon. But in 2007, all the libraries in Josephine County closed down for a number of reasons.</p>  <p>It devastated her daughters who were then 7 and 5. ""Lucy told me she was really sad she wouldn't get to 'visit the books,' "" Roberts said, remembering her daughter sobbing at the news.</p>  <p>Roberts was determined to find a way to help reopen the libraries in her area. The community banded together to raise $300,000 in 18 months. They even got a matching grant from Josephine County, which helped the libraries reopen.</p>  <p>The experience helped Roberts rediscover the value of her local library. ""I actually didn't grow up visiting many libraries,"" she said. ""I didn't discover that wonder until I was much older. Perhaps that's why they seem so magical to me now.""</p>  <p>'Libraries reflect who we are'</p>  <p>Robert Dawson wanted to capture the value of public libraries through his lens. He spent the past 18 years photographing libraries and interviewing people who work and use them. In his recently published book, ""The Public Library: A Photographic Essay,"" which includes hundreds of photographs of libraries in 48 states, Dawson says he was drawn to libraries because they are vital part of a community's ecosystem.</p>  <p>""Often times, a library reveals things about a community. It was really sad to see a closed library when I was passing through the Mississippi Delta,"" he said, explaining how that was one of the poorer regions he visited.</p>  <p>""I am not a librarian, but 18 years of doing this, you peel away things,"" he said. ""It's interesting how libraries reflect who we are, and what we share.</p>  <p>Barbara Stripling , president of the American Library Association , says libraries are also incredibly transformative. These spaces offer not only information but also provide resources and opportunities to socialize.</p>  <p>Some libraries are ""becoming more of a community sharing, learning, conversation space,"" she explained. Programs such as the Chicago Public Library's One Book, One Chicago , an initiative adopted from the Seattle Public Library, aims to rally virtual community engagement around monthly book selections.</p>  <p>Take a tour of the world's most exquisite libraries</p>  <p>Others are rebranding themselves as places where people can explore their passions. Programs such as Geek the Library , which is part of OCLC, partners with libraries to promote the idea that everyone ""geeks out"" about something, and a local library can help you recognize your special passion.</p>  <p>Through his 18 years of documenting libraries, Dawson says he's seen many of them adapt and transform for their communities. Some took on new daily roles, such as teaching people to write resumes or providing social services.</p>  <p>""In San Francisco, they have a dedicated social worker , especially for the homeless,"" he said. Others became safe havens.</p>  <p>""When I was in Detroit, it one of the hottest days on record, I walked into a library. There was this huge guard at the front, the air conditioning was blasting, it was packed, and everyone was reading. And I sort of got it -- it was a place of shelter.""</p>  <p>Olaf Eigenbrodt , librarian and senior head of user services and adviser for planning and construction at State and University Library Hamburg in Germany , says there are three main reasons why libraries continue to be popular today: They are information hotspots; they are places communities can gather; and they provide learning collaboration.</p>  <p>They even provide an element of comfort. ""Libraries tend to become more cozy, relaxing and communicative places. Other than public spaces like museums, they have a certain private character, which makes them a living room for their community,"" Eigenbrodt said.</p>  <p>Dawson thinks a part of people's fascination with libraries is sort of irrational, too, but in a good way. He attributes our love for libraries to our childhood memories. ""I think a lot of it goes back to being a kid. There's an emotional connection that is somewhat unique. A lot of kids discover libraries with their parents when they are younger,"" he explained.</p>  <p>That affinity can be partially psychological, according to De Rosa of OCLC. ""I would find it difficult to find 10 people in a crowd who didn't have a positive experience in a library. That's a personal thing,"" she said.

The 36-year-old photographer loves the thrill of meeting the barrel of a wave head on, shooting waves as his passion and shooting surfers to pay the bills.</p>  <p>Some of his business involves creating Instagram promotions for Dos Equis, Maui Sunrise Shells and other companies. He has been able to shoot some of the most beautiful and untouched beaches in South America and Mexico through a Kickstarter fundraising campaign.</p>  <p>But most of his wave photos are taken close to home. His favorite moment? When the sun rises at Sandy Beach in Oahu, Hawaii, but the waves there are good at any hour. What Croman loves about waves is how each one is unpredictable and as unique as a fingerprint. And he captures waves from an angle that allows spectators to see them breaking in slow motion as he does.</p>  <p>The process of photographing waves requires more than just swimming out to where the surf breaks and waiting, he says.</p>  <p>The night before a photo shoot Croman checks Surfline.com , a website and streaming coastal HD camera network that provides live and predicted ocean weather information, to see what the winds, waves and tide will be like at certain times.</p>  <p>""If the winds are blowing offshore, this creates nice barrels and usually better conditions than if the winds are blowing onshore.""</p>  <p>Croman has both a primary camera and a backup for emergencies. He goes without a wetsuit but wears fins and uses heavy duty underwater housing to protect his camera.</p>  <p>There is no great way for him to protect himself.</p>  <p>He admits there is probably protective gear he should be wearing, but there is little he could have done to decrease the impact of the 10-foot wave that crashed on top of him. Croman was rushed to the hospital where his doctor initially thought he had broken his neck. His neck was fine, but he was hospitalized for a week and spinal fluid leaked out of his ear, he says.</p>  <p>The hardest part of Croman's job is staying calm in the face of breaking waves when his initial instinct is to panic and swim away. He once risked his life to shoot a 25-foot wave but the resulting photo ""looked like a three-foot wave,"" he says. The 25-foot rock in the background ""didn't give it the right depth you need to show how big the wave was.""</p>  <p>Croman studies the swells, searching for patterns and trying to time when a wave will break. At most, Croman will take two to three shots of a single wave.</p>  <p>""I've shot waves for so many years now that I see the wave in slow motion,"" he said.</p>  <p>Travel photos we wish we'd taken</p>  <p>Blood Falls and more natural oddities</p> "

The wandering traveler will find these envy-inducing castles in every corner of Scotland.</p>  <p>In honor of Sunday's National Tartan Day , a holiday celebrating the influential role Scots have played in American history, CNN has chosen 10 magnificent castles to explore in the old country.</p>  <p>From the capital city of Edinburgh to the dramatic landscapes of the Highlands, here are some of the most striking castles in Scotland. Cue the castle-owning daydreaming.</p>  <p>27 photos of glorious Ireland</p>  <p>Eilean Donan, Inverness-shire</p>  <p>This 13th-century castle in the middle of a loch is one of the most iconic in Scotland. Located in the Highlands looking out toward the Isle of Skye, this stunning castle is connected to the mainland via footbridge. It was restored in the early 20th century and is often featured in television and movies. Visitors can wander through the rooms to see period furniture, artifacts and weaponry.</p>  <p>Edinburgh Castle, City of Edinburgh</p>  <p>Perhaps the most famous (and most visited) castle in Scotland is right in the center of the capital city. Perched on top of the city on Castle Rock, this fortress has a strong presence in Edinburgh's skyline. The oldest section of the castle dates to the 12th century, and many visitors travel here specifically to see the Crown Jewels of Scotland. Guided tours are available.</p>  <p>Culzean Castle, Ayrshire</p>  <p>Observant travelers might recognize Culzean Castle from the back of the 5-pound note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland. This cliffside castle on the Ayrshire coast has been associated with the Kennedy family for centuries. It is a particularly memorable example of a fairy tale-like structure with its turrets and battlements, stationed above the stormy seas and surrounded by gardens and forests.</p>  <p>Ballindalloch Castle, Banffshire</p>  <p>Often called ""The Pearl of the North,"" this 16th-century castle is in the heart of one of Scotland's whisky regions, Speyside. Unlike other castles in Scotland, this is one of the few castles in the country that remains private: The Macpherson-Grant family has continually lived here over the centuries. The castle is open to visitors during the summer months and has a shop with a variety of Scottish goods including tartans and jewelry.</p>  <p>8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels</p>  <p>Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire</p>  <p>Movie buffs might recognize Castle Fraser from ""The Queen,"" starring Helen Mirren (it appeared as a backdrop). Castle Fraser is one of the grandest, most romantic-looking castles in the country. Built between 1575 and 1636, the castle sits on more than 300 acres of landscaped grounds and woodlands. Inside, it has the feeling of a family home with portraits of the Fraser family and original furniture.</p>  <p>Stirling Castle, Stirlingshire</p>  <p>One of the largest (and most important from a historic/architectural perspective) castles is Stirling Castle . An easy trip from both Edinburgh and Glasgow, this castle was once the destination of knights and nobles who flocked to the luxurious property with its elaborate gardens. It's a good spot for families to visit; costumed characters in historic roles are on the grounds, and children can dress up in period costumes and play medieval instruments.</p>  <p>Earth's greatest unexplored places</p>  <p>Urquhart Castle, Inverness-shire</p>  <p>The mythical Loch Ness Monster, Nessie, might lure travelers to the Scottish Highlands, but it is Urquhart Castle that delivers the drama. One of the most-visited castles in the country, this castle's Grand Tower overlooks expansive Loch Ness. An early medieval fortification was built here, but the ruins seen today date to the 13th to 16th centuries. The castle also played a strategic role in the Wars of Scottish Independence.</p>  <p>Glamis Castle, Angus</p>  <p>One of the most towering -- and historically interesting -- castles in Scotland is Glamis Castle . This structure has the claim to fame as being the setting for Shakespeare's ""Macbeth,"" along with being the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (her younger daughter, Princess Margaret, was born here). The surrounding estate is made up of 14,000 acres of gardens, farms and forests.</p>  <p>Inveraray Castle, Argyllshire</p>  <p>Located in western Scotland on the shore of Loch Fyne, this castle has a fairytale facade with an enchanting interior. Many visitors indulge in the tea room here, offering a glimpse into royal life. ""Downton Abbey"" fans might recognize it from the season 3 Christmas episode. The castle has a lovely 16-acre garden surrounded by a massive 60,000-acre estate.</p>  <p>Crathes Castle, Aberdeenshire</p>  <p>Found in the Aberdeenshire woodlands, Crathes Castle dates to the 16th century and has ties to Scottish warrior-king Robert the Bruce. Towers, turrets, and ghost stories make this an especially intriguing castle to visit, along with the beautiful walled garden. Travelers interested in art will be drawn to the collection of portraits and painted ceilings.</p> "

This summer, Universal Orlando will open the doors, or rather the secret entrance, to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter -- Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida.</p>  <p>Once inside the elaborately themed area, which has been in the works since the summer of 2010, guests will feel like they've stepped onto the London film set, complete with the popular wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron, several iconic shops and a marquee roller coaster-type attraction based on Gringotts, the goblin-run bank from the series.</p>  <p>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter -- Hogsmeade, which opened in June 2010 at Universal's Islands of Adventure, was one of the most talked about new attractions of the past decade within the industry and has been wildly popular ever since. By August 2010, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, the star attraction at Hogsmeade, hit a million riders.</p>  <p>Parent company NBC Universal reported a theme park revenue increase of more than 30% in 2010, thanks in large part to the Wizarding World's opening that year. In 2011, theme park revenue jumped again by nearly 25%, followed by a modest gain in 2012 of about 5%.</p>  <p>""Park operators from around the world were impressed by the immersive experience Universal created and the meticulous attention to detail they used to bring the Harry Potter stories to life,"" says David Mandt, vice president of communications for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. ""There is great anticipation within the industry to see how Diagon Alley will build on that success.""</p>  <p>CNN got a tour of the 20-acre construction site, which roughly doubles the size of the Harry Potter experience, where thousands of designers, engineers and craftspeople are hard at work preparing for opening day.</p>  <p>Here are some things to know:</p>  <p>It's hidden : The outside of this attraction is a hodgepodge of building facades built to scale, including the Wyndham Theater, Leicester Square's tube station and Grimmauld Place, which mask the entrance to Diagon Alley. Here, guests will be able to meander along the London waterfront, sit under the shade of trees and gaze at a replica of London's Eros fountain. Guests will enter under the arches of the Leicester Square facade. However, Universal has not said how exactly. In the series, Harry enters Diagon through a magical wall of bricks.</p>  <p>Once inside, guests will be immediately immersed in a bustling wizarding hub within a Muggle city where towering buildings are slightly askew, with steep staircases and jagged edges galore.</p>  <p>There will be goblins : The star of it all is Gringotts, which in the series is a massive, goblin-run bank that Harry visits to get money for his school supplies. In the real-life version, visitors will be in awe of the marble lobby and cavernous passageways. They'll take off from here on a multi-sensory thrill ride through the vaults. And the dragon that will perch atop the bank building (reminiscent of when it escapes from the bank in the series) really does blow a giant ball of fire quite frequently, says Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative.</p>  <p>Your ticket to Universal Studios gives you access to Diagon Alley: Admission into Universal Studios Florida ($92 for adults and $86 for kids ages 3 to 9), allows you to roam around the park and visit Diagon Alley. However, if you'd like to pop over to Hogsmeade via the Hogwarts Express, you must purchase park-to-park admission ($128 for adults, $122 for kids ages 3 to 9).</p>  <p>The train, where Harry meets pals Hermione and Ron in the first movie, will shuttle people over to Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure. Along the way, rather than seeing backstage areas between the parks, guests will see views of London and the British countryside thanks to some high-tech features.</p>  <p>It goes beyond the books/films: J.K. Rowling provided Universal with names that didn't exist in the book. For instance, in Diagon Alley, visitors will find Horizont Alley and Carkitt next to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and the train trellis.</p>  <p>Although the world-famous author has not toured the site yet, ""She has been involved as usual in the development process and has been a great supporter throughout the process as she was in the original in 2010,"" says Woodbury. ""Just a delight to work with and a wonderful author. And someone we are eternally grateful to for creating a body of fiction that is so rich that gives us an opportunity to develop what we've been able to do.""</p>  <p>There will be new merchandise and foods: All the bits and bobs that any good wizard needs will, of course, be available.</p>  <p>Shops will include Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions for Hogwarts scarves and character costumes; the three-story Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes shop for magical jokes and toys; the Magical Menagerie for owl and Hippogriff stuffed animals; Quality Quidditch Supplies for brooms and quaffles and more. Wand shop Ollivanders will be there, too. (Note: The Ollivanders location found within Diagon Alley is the original location, as referenced in the Harry Potter books and films. This shop will be larger than the current one found within Hogsmeade at Islands of Adventure.)</p>  <p>The Leaky Cauldron, a popular wizarding pub and inn from the series, will be a ""colossal space"" serving Butterbeer and traditional English pub fare. Nearby, Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour will serve weird flavors like strawberry with peanut butter.</p>  <p>It will blow Hogsmeade away: ""We think the experience is exponential,"" says Woodbury. ""It's not just one and one is two. In this case, it's one and one is six.""</p>  <p>Actor Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom in the films, concurs: ""It's ridiculous,"" Lewis said after touring the site yesterday. ""The scale of it, it's just enormous.""</p> "
"224","10 trips to change a kid's life","CNN.com","2013-04-08 12:15:00","2014-10-06 05:59:01","http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/03/travel/national-geographic-kids-travel/index.html","Travel"," <p>Travel can introduce kids to the world's real-life wonders, changing their perspective on topics they may have only read about in books.</p>  <p>It can literally change their lives.</p>  <p>""There is a kid's way of seeing the world,"" says Keith Bellows, editor-in-chief of National Geographic Traveler magazine and author of National Geographic's ""100 Places That Can Change Your Child's Life."" ""As an adult, get out of the way, and stop marching them through an experience. When you get them to slow down and experience a place from their perspective, it's magic. Not just the place itself, but the experience.""</p>  <p>Consider Bellows' suggestions a step up from simply taking a vacation. He says these places could open your child's eyes to the diversity of the world, help them learn what interests them and inform how they navigate it as adults.</p>  <p>Marco Island, Florida</p>  <p>Of course Walt Disney World is a Florida rite of passage for many children (and their parents) but there's so much to the state that isn't prefabricated. Marco Island is one of those places for Bellows, with beaches showing off the rusticity and charm of old Florida. Kids will love the beach and you can sneak in some science in the spectacular nature surrounding you.</p>  <p>To Disney or not to Disney?</p>  <p>Get on board the Dolphin Explorer with your children and turn them into citizen scientists. Capt. Chris Desmond, founder of the 10,000 Islands Dolphins Project, directs children to note the family compositions, behavior and even evidence of shark bites of the dolphins they spot. They give the data to adult biologists onboard who feed it into a computer. The bonus: If a child spots a new dolphin -- most are already known to the crew -- that child gets to name the dolphin. ""Every kid wants to spot a newcomer and it happened on a trip I was on,"" says Bellows.</p>  <p>Big Sur, California</p>  <p>The drive from San Francisco into Big Sur may be Bellows' favorite drive in the world. ""It is one of the most hair-raising drives in the world, and you get the sense of a wild, driving adventure,"" he says. ""I've done it at least 40 or 50 times, and I never get tired of it.""</p>  <p>He recommends renting a convertible and coming down from San Francisco through the agriculture fields onto the California coast, much of which is protected and can be explored along the way. One highlight: Point Lobos State Natural Reserve , just north of Big Sur. ""It really teaches children that if you really love an area, you can protect it. Most of that coastline is protected, and it shows you what happens when you don't screw it up. ""</p>  <p>Grand Canyon</p>  <p>Nothing makes Bellows feel more humble than standing on the lip of the Grand Canyon , even if he's standing with thousands of other people. ""It's a bite out of the Earth, a thrilling glimpse into the inside of the Earth,"" he says.</p>  <p>Top U.S. spots for family fun</p>  <p>When children see the canyon layers below, that's the first step in their understanding of the geology of the Earth, says Bellows. Take an age-appropriate hike so your children can see the layers and wildlife that make up the canyon. ""They can see we didn't just spring from nothing. This is a wafer sandwich of the world, and we're going to be one of the layers one day.""</p>  <p>Chesapeake Bay, Maryland</p>  <p>The nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay is filled with 64,000 square miles of rivers, marshes and bays. ""My kids have grown up there kneeling in grass, looking for tadpoles and pulling up crab pots ... and I love it,"" says Bellows. ""It's some of the wildest primitive country we have. You can watch the ebb and flow of oysters, crabs and fishes, and it tells you how you're treating this incredible place.""</p>  <p>It's the home of the wild ponies children have read about it in Marguerite Henry's ""Misty of Chincoteague."" Those ponies o f Assateague Island National Seashore live in two herds. You can see the ponies at the park but don't feed them (to keep them wild).</p>  <p>Library of Congress, Washington</p>  <p>It's OK to tell your children that the movie ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" was filmed at the Library of Congress . (Heck, show them the movie in advance of your trip.) And yes, that it's the biggest library in the world with 3,800 staff, 500 miles of shelving and 128 million items (with about 10,000 items added each day).</p>  <p>7 tips for cherry blossom fun in D.C .</p>  <p>""If you go into the Library of Congress, you're going to tell them it's a library but it's also a treasure trove,"" says Bellows. Whatever your child likes, whether it's music or maps or sports or humor, it's likely he or she can find something about it here.</p>  <p>Your children also can get a ""Passport to Knowledge"" to guide them to the library's so-called greatest hits, and they can play at Knowledge Quest kiosks and bookmark places of interest to explore later on a personalized mini-site.</p>  <p>New York City</p>  <p>A visit to New York for every child who has not grown up there is also a rite of passage, says Bellows. ""Every kid has to go to New York City, and every adult does, too,"" he says. ""Every time you go back and haven't been there for awhile, it's a new place. It's so big and so fast.""</p>  <p>Take the Circle Line boat tour, he suggests, so you can see by sailing around it how small an island Manhattan actually is. You can notice how connected it is to the other islands of Staten Island and Long Island (where Brooklyn and Queens are) and the Bronx, which is actually on the U.S mainland. ""Here's an island in the middle of nowhere but it's connected to the entire world.""</p>  <p>For children seeing the Statue of Liberty, a Broadway show or the city decorated at Christmas for the first time, ""it gets imprinted on kids' minds.""</p>  <p>London</p>  <p>London is a starter city for U.S. parents who want to take their kids out of the country, after you've explored the nearest metropolitan city and your national parks. ""They speak English in London but a child will know just how foreign it is, with things like Marmite,"" says Bellows. ""The wonderful thing about it is, this is a little like Harry Potter world. It's familiar enough to be safe and foreign enough to be thrilling.""</p>  <p>Older children will love the ghoulish (and true) tales of the Tower of London . Begun in the 1070s by William the Conqueror, the tower was Europe's first fortress. Queen Anne Boleyn was beheaded there in 1536 and is rumored to still haunt the place.</p>  <p>Trim, Ireland</p>  <p>How could medieval warriors run in chain mail armor? How heavy is a stone ax, really? Head to the ruins of the Dominican Black Friary, a short distance from Trim Castle in the town of Trim, Ireland.</p>  <p>Once a home for religious men and women, the friary's ruins are being excavated in a special way. Visitors can get a crash course in excavation and start digging and recording their findings side-by-side with archaeologists and geologists. Younger children get to play at a camp, where they get to pick up heavy stone axes and run in chain mail.</p>  <p>Older children will enjoy a tour of nearby Trim Castle, which starred in the movie ""Braveheart."" Hugh de Lacy and his son Walter began construction of the castle, the largest Anglo-Norman castle in Ireland, in the 1170s. The castle protected the medieval village, once a commercial and religious powerhouse.</p>  <p>""What amazing architects these people were, and how remarkably old this is,"" says Bellows. ""It's the quintessential castle. It's knights, bow and arrows and blood on the ground.""</p>  <p>Muskoka, Canada</p>  <p>Bellows grew up in Muskoka , two hours north of Toronto in Ontario's cottage country. ""This is where kids can really connect with wilderness, even more so than the Chesapeake,"" he says.</p>  <p>""There are dark lakes and loons at night. You can come out to a fish, flip the canoes and find the air holes underneath.""</p>  <p>Almost anyone can rent a cabin in this area known for its more than 1,600 lakes and leave electronic entertainment behind, he says. ""It is simple, simple living. You can take off your shoes for days"" and simply run around barefoot.</p>  <p>Galapagos Islands</p>  <p>There's no doubt this trip is expensive. People who want to visit the Galapagos Islands have to take approved tours, designed to protect the islands' fragile ecology. This is where Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution, where nearby islands have different ecologies and animals who have adapted differently to their environments.</p>  <p>""There is no place like it in the world,"" says Bellows. ""I've been twice, and the first time I went, I realized what Darwin was talking about. You see two birds who look the same but they have different vocalizations. It's like two people speaking English but one person is from Brooklyn and the other is from Boston.""</p>  <p>The animals have no fear of humans, so your children will swim with dolphins and turtles and play near seals. But it's not all peaceful.</p>  <p>""I saw a seal attacked by a shark and dying, tortoises leaning into each other, both dead,"" he says. ""You're on a beach and you see crabs hatch prematurely in the middle of the day, slowly breaking down. It's Darwin's theory of evolution and the survival of the fittest.""</p>  <p>A tough, but essential, life lesson.</p>  <p>Where do you want to take your children before they grow up?

Decades before anyone else considered legalizing marijuana, prostitution or gay marriage, the Dutch stood -- as they still do today -- at the forefront of change on many controversial social issues, legalizing or tolerating a range of activities that other countries placed squarely outside what they consider legally and socially acceptable.</p>  <p>That is not to say other countries did not have recreational drugs, homosexuality and prostitution. But the Dutch, with their history of practicality and compromise, decided to deal with these matters in a pragmatic way. In the process, they created a whole new world for tourists craving tolerance and a brush with the forbidden.</p>  <p>Amsterdam remains a magnet for travelers who find the idea of smoking marijuana in public -- perhaps in front of a passing cop to add to the experience -- simply irresistible.</p>  <p>Still, there are great misconceptions about what is and is not legal here. The picture of a hedonistic free-for-all is not altogether accurate.</p>  <p>The Dutch are a people of rules and laws. Although they also have an interesting approach to certain issues, where the law says one thing and the official policy is to look the other way.</p>  <p>8 hotels still fresh at 100</p>  <p>So what, precisely, is legal in the Netherlands?</p>  <p>You may be surprised to learn that recreational drugs are illegal in the Netherlands. Yes, even pot. But an official policy of tolerance emerged and in 1976 the Dutch parliament decriminalized possession of less than 5 grams of cannabis. That gave rise to a type of establishment found only in this country. In hundreds of ""coffee shops"" across the country -- not to be confused with ""cafes"" where you, in fact, go for coffee -- you can select from a menu of cannabis products and light up in full view indoors or at a sidewalk table.</p>  <p>It is the crowded, cloudy coffee shops that give Amsterdam its unmistakable summer aroma.</p>  <p>The city is also home to countless seed shops, a hash and marijuana museum, and other businesses aimed at extracting cash from the peculiarly happy drug tourists.</p>  <p>Things got a little complicated in 2008, when the Netherlands, as other countries, imposed restrictions on smoking in public places . A great battle ensued as coffee shop owners complained the ban would put them out of business. Dutch compromising ensued. So, today, you cannot smoke in most public establishments, but you can still smoke marijuana in a coffee shop.</p>  <p>All non-medical drugs, to be clear, are illegal. But there are two categories. Cannabis and some types of ""recreational mushrooms"" are in a separate class; still illegal, but largely tolerated. The most powerful type of ""magic mushrooms,"" containing psilocybin, were made illegal in 2008, but authorities say they will not prosecute anyone holding very small quantities. Hashish is also in a gray area, up to each municipality to decide.</p>  <p>Not everyone likes this openness. Weed tourism is controversial in some circles and there are worries that lax laws attract more than just the tattoos and scraggly beard crowd, encouraging drug traffickers to enter the market.</p>  <p>Weed aficionados across parts of the world panicked a couple of years ago when a conservative government announced plans to stem drug tourism , partly as a result of friction with neighboring countries. Under the new rules, coffee shops would issue membership cards, Weed Passes, only to local residents. Foreigners would not be able to come to the Netherlands to get high.</p>  <p>But, as coffee shop owners admit, it's not the Dutch who are lighting up. Ninety percent of the customers getting buzzed in Amsterdam are foreigners. Amsterdam authorities complained the plan would take a huge financial toll, as millions of visitors every year inhale the offerings of coffee shop menus.</p>  <p>After a very Dutch debate on the pros and cons of the plan, the government rewrote the law, leaving it up to each city to decide on the rules. Amsterdam scrapped it, while Maastricht, on the border with Germany and Belgium, left the ban in place and imposed fines on coffee shop owners defying the ban on pot sales to foreigners.</p>  <p>So, to recap: No cigarette smoking in public; yes to pot in small quantities, but not in Maastricht, and mushrooms are OK in very small quantities.</p>  <p>Today, pot smokers can be found meandering aimlessly along Amsterdam's famous Red Light district, the warren of alleyways and canals where prostitutes rent small rooms and stand in their windows, bathed in the light of red lamps before potential customers and sightseers. Policemen pedal easily alongside visitors, keeping an eye on the scene.</p>  <p>Prostitution and brothels have been legal in the Netherlands since 2000. Prostitutes are supposed to have work permits and enjoy the protections of the country's labor laws.</p>  <p>Another area of controversy in which the Dutch moved swiftly to the fore of social change is gay marriage. The Netherlands was the first country to fully legalize marriage equality. In 2001, the world's first same-sex ceremony was conducted by then-Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen. You can't come to the Netherlands with your beloved to tie the knot, however: One of the partners has to be a Dutch resident.</p>  <p>You can, however, share the city with the hundreds of thousands of Amsterdammers who ride their bicycles to and from work every day. The law does not require you to wear a helmet and practically no one does. You are, however, required to have a light and a bell on your bike. If you walk, make sure to stay out of the official bike lanes. If you choose to drive a car, it is illegal to use a mobile phone while you drive, and if you run into a bicycle, Dutch law places the responsibility on the driver of the car. So, if you go to a coffee shop, better not drive a car, or even a bicycle.</p>  <p>Your friends are right. Lucky you if you've come to Amsterdam. It's a very special city. Whether or not you want to enjoy the freedom of Amsterdam, just remember there's much more to the Netherlands than coffee shops and red lights. And the Rijksmuseum is definitely worth a visit.</p> "

From ancient objects to art that was conceived yesterday, these carefully curated fairs offer the best of the best to their audiences.</p>  <p>Attending one is like walking through a museum where everything is for sale -- to anyone with adequate funds. Yet even if you're not equipped to buy, you can still visit these fairs, take part in the spectacle and feed your aspirations.</p>  <p>5 train stations worth a stop</p>  <p>Maastricht, The Netherlands</p>  <p>Held annually in Maastricht, the European Fine Art Fair is the art fair by which all others are measured.</p>  <p>""There is no other fair like it,"" says Lawrence Steigrad, a New York City fine art dealer who specializes in Old Master paintings. At the fair in March, he sold an 1810 painting by Dutch artist Nicolaas Baur to the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.</p>  <p>That's the level of ""shopper"" who attends this fair: museum curators, serious collectors and those who aspire to be serious collectors. Calvin Klein and Kanye West are among those who have been spotted at the invitation-only preview day in recent years. They come because the quality and authenticity of every piece -- from antiquities to contemporary art -- undergoes what is acknowledged in the art world to be the strictest vetting process of any art fair.</p>  <p>After the preview day, the fair is open to all. The ticket price is considerable, but the chance to see and possibly purchase such art, antiques and objects is extraordinary. The next fair takes place March 14-23, 2014, and there's talk of launching a TEFAF Beijing fair as well.</p>  <p>Maastricht , in the southern Netherlands near Belgium, is known as a place where Amsterdam residents go for a weekend break.</p>  <p>The cafes and restaurants around Vrijthof Square are lively and comfortable. Selexyz Dominicanen, housed in a former Dominican church, is one of the world's most beautiful bookstores, and the Bonnefantenmuseum is an excellent place to see art all year round.</p>  <p>The places where masterpieces are born</p>  <p>London</p>  <p>Ever since its debut four years ago, Masterpiece London has been gaining a reputation as a mini-TEFAF. Installed in a specially built pavilion on the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, Masterpiece specializes in fine art, antiques and design, and adds luxury goods -- cars, yachts, watches and wines -- to the mix of offerings.</p>  <p>Everything is vetted, everything is expensive, and Prince Harry was one of the VIP attendees in 2011. The list of exhibitors is hovering around 200 for this year's fair, which will take place June 26-July 3.</p>  <p>Yet the even newer fair that everyone's talking about now is Frieze Masters , an adjunct to Frieze London , both of which will take place October 17-20. While Frieze London showcases contemporary art, Frieze Masters, which premiered in 2012, is for everything pre-21st-century.</p>  <p>Last year's exhibitors included 90 international dealers; attendees included curators from around the world; and sales included ancient Mesopotamian artifacts, Renaissance marbles, a couple of Picassos and a Joan Miró painting with an eight-figure asking price.</p>  <p>When you're in London, it's never hard to find great art to visit at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Tate Modern the British Museum or the Royal Academy of Arts. Put the London Transport Museum on your list as well. Its ""Poster Art 150 -- London Underground's Greatest Designs"" exhibition (through October 27) features art that everyone can understand.</p>  <p>Gatsby's Gold Coast: 8 grand estates</p>  <p>Venice</p>  <p>There are other biennial international art exhibitions, but when people talk about ""the Biennale,"" they're talking about Venice.</p>  <p>This being an odd-numbered year, the city is preparing the 55th Venice Biennale -- a nearly six-month-long festival (June 1 to November 24) with pavilions and art installations throughout the city. An architecture Biennale runs in even-numbered years.</p>  <p>The Biennale seeps into every nook and cranny of the city, and the year won't be the only odd thing about it. For artists, the chance to represent their countries at the Venice Biennale can be a career-making moment. The path to greatness isn't easy, however, and neither is the art, which is typically conceptual, avant-garde and often (not to put too fine a point on it) just plain weird.</p>  <p>Of the 88 nations represented by national pavilions, 10 are exhibiting for the first time. One is Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan whose installation includes a re-enactment of Robert Peary's 1909 expedition to the North Pole. The installation by Vincent J.F. Huang, representing Tuvalu (another first-time participant) involves suicidal penguins. Sarah Sze will represent the United States with an installation called ""Triple Point."" Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is one of four international artists who will create the installation in the German pavilion.</p>  <p>At times, it can seem that the Biennale is inescapable. Whether that's good or bad depends on your taste.</p>  <p>If, after seeing the newest of the new, you're longing for a cleansing immersion in classical or decorative art, the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia will satisfy you.</p>  <p>Basel, Switzerland</p>  <p>When it comes to art fairs that truly put their cities on the map, Art Basel tops the list. In 1970, three Basel gallery owners joined forces and invited their ""gallerist"" colleagues to Basel to exhibit the works of their current clients. Ninety galleries from 10 countries exhibited, more than 16,000 people attended, and with that one bold move, Basel became a modern and contemporary art pilgrimage destination.</p>  <p>The 2012 Art Basel saw 300 galleries from 36 countries exhibiting and more than 65,000 curators and collectors attending. It's a happening -- and no one who's passionate about contemporary art would miss it.</p>  <p>Art Basel is limited to 20th and 21st century art, and the emphasis is on the new. So, yes, you'll see Warhol and the occasional Leger, but you're more likely to encounter Cindy Sherman, Phyllida Barlow, Edward Ruscha, and Takashi Murakami among the offerings (and possibly among the attendees). In addition to the gallery exhibitors, there are installations of site-specific artworks open to the public free of charge in the Art Parcours section of the fair.</p>  <p>The next Art Basel takes place June 13-16, 2013.</p>  <p>With 40 museums to serve a population of around 165,000, Basel rightly claims the title of Switzerland's culture capital. Recently, Kunstmuseum Basel has been welcoming crowds for its excellent Picasso retrospective (through July 21). In nearby Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Vitra Design Museum is celebrating the work of American architect Louis Kahn (through August 11).</p>  <p>Just as thrilling to locals and sports fans alike, the local soccer team, FC Basel , was the defending Swiss champion until they were defeated on Monday by Zurich-based club Grasshopper for the Swiss Cup title.</p>  <p>Miami Beach, Florid a</p>  <p>It's not really cheating to include Art Basel Miami Beach on this list. Yes, the show is an offshoot of the original in Switzerland, but as it approaches its 12th year, Art Basel Miami Beach has earned its stripes in the art community -- and not merely because it gives everyone an excuse to visit Florida in the winter. (The even newer Art Basel Hong Kong kicks off its inaugural show this month, from May 23 to 26.)</p>  <p>Held at the Miami Beach Convention Center, Art Basel Miami Beach features more than 200 exhibitors showcasing the work of some 4,000 artists and competition to be included is fierce -- close to 700 galleries applied to show at Art Basel Miami Beach last year.</p>  <p>As at the original Art Basel, the focus here is on the new, but in Miami Beach, there's emphasis on artists and galleries from the United States and Latin America. The Art Nova and Art Positions sections of the fair showcase recent works, and young and emerging artists. The Art Public section, organized in cooperation with the Bass Museum of Art, places art installations in Collins Park.</p>  <p>The next Art Basel Miami Beach takes place December 5-8.</p>  <p>Miami and Miami Beach have a number of private art collections open to the public.</p>  <p>The Rubell Family Collection is among the world's most respected private collections, featuring works by top 20th century artists and burgeoning contemporary artists. The Margulies Collection at the Warehouse includes works by Olafur Eliasson, Sol LeWitt, Willem de Kooning and Richard Serra. And in 2009, Carlos and Rosa de la Cruz opened the de la Cruz Collection Contemporary Art Space to showcase their collection of contemporary art.</p> "

Jacobs , the guy who lived life according to the Bible for a year for his book ""The Year of Living Biblically"" and tried every imaginable diet and workout for another book, ""Drop Dead Healthy.""</p>  <p>He's now trying to build a family tree of the entire world (and stage the world's biggest family reunion -- more on that later). His inspiration, he says, came from an email from a man who said he was Jacobs' 12th cousin.</p>  <p>""I was a little bit creeped out,"" Jacobs joked during an interview. ""But then it turned out he really was. He had a family tree of 80,000 people on it.""</p>  <p>Jacobs, an editor at large for Esquire magazine and a father of three, said he became obsessed with genealogy, playing around on sites such as Geni.com, WikiTree.com and FamilySearch.com, which he says have ""megamonster family trees"" with millions of people on them.</p>  <p>He's also interviewed hundreds of people -- from scientists to genealogists to statisticians -- and is working with hundreds of volunteers to create the world's family tree and track down his own cousins.</p>  <p>He learned he's related to celebrities (Gwyneth Paltrow, Olivia Wilde), current and former presidents (Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush), and even a wizard. OK, not a real wizard exactly.</p>  <p>""A.J. Jacobs is my cousin, and I'm his cousin, and we are probably cousins,"" said Daniel Radcliffe of ""Harry Potter"" fame in a video for Jacobs' project. (Side note: If my daughters learn we're related to ""Harry Potter,"" they will fully expect an invitation to Hogwarts!)</p>  <p>(To find out who you are related to, head to GlobalFamilyReunion.com and try to have the names and approximate birth dates of your grandparents and the names of any semi-famous relatives and ancestors handy!)</p>  <p>Jacobs likes to show how some of the people you would never imagine are related actually are. For example, he points to Obama and his 44 cousins in the U.S. Senate, including Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the biggest critics in the Congress of the Obama administration.</p>  <p>Cruz is actually the husband of the President's 14th cousin once removed .</p>  <p>""Wonder how they'll take the news?"" I asked Jacobs.</p>  <p>""I'm hoping it would nudge people to be a little more open-minded,"" he said, admitting to being slightly idealistic. ""I don't think it's going to cause world peace to break out, but I think it will help. It can't hurt.""</p>  <p>Now will the Obamas invite the Cruzes for Christmas dinner? And will they invite my family since we are related to the Obamas, too?</p>  <p>""I just love the fact you can take any two people, any two people on the street ... and see how they're related,"" said Jacobs, declining to speculate on whether we'll actually get a holiday invitation from the first family. ""And it drives home this extraordinary fact that we all do come from the same ancestors.""</p>  <p>""We are all one big family.""</p>  <p>In that spirit, Jacobs is planning what he calls a Global Family Reunion for June 6, 2015, in New York City. Tell your first and second and third cousins and beyond, because Jacobs is trying to break the Guinness Book of World Records when it comes to family reunions.</p>  <p>The current record is 4,514, he said. ""I'm shooting for at least 5,000 at my family reunion.""</p>  <p>I asked Jacobs if he's worried that the current record holder, a family in France, might get wind of his project and try to top it.</p>  <p>""Listen I am very inclusive. I welcome the competition,"" he said. ""I want my reunion to have satellite reunions around the world. Maybe they can have their reunion at the same time. I've got to give them a call.""</p>  <p>Jacobs' effort to hold the largest family reunion ever will be the subject of a book he's writing. The documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, host of CNN's '""Inside Man,"" is also making a movie about it. All proceeds from the Global Family Reunion will go to fight Alzheimer's, a disease that ""affects 60 million members of the human family,"" he said.</p>  <p>There is one downside to the ""we are all related"" concept, he conceded. Let's just say it can get uncomfortable at times, such as when you marry your cousin.</p>  <p>""It did happen to me,"" said Jacobs. He and his wife did DNA testing using the site 23andMe.com and learned they are cousins -- not second or third cousins but distant cousins nonetheless.</p>  <p>""I think it adds a little spice to the marriage,"" said Jacobs with a smile, which seemed to imply that I might stop laughing once he told me more.</p>  <p>""I am sorry to say you are married to your cousin as well,"" he said. ""You married your cousin, so did everybody watching.""</p>  <p>Oh my!</p>  <p>Would you attend the Global Family Reunion? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook .</p> "
"228","An orientation to asexuality","CNN.com","2014-09-24 13:25:15","2014-10-06 06:01:53","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/23/living/asexual-relationships-relate/index.html","Living"," <p>They're not frigid, sick, repressed or broken.</p>  <p>Meeting the so-called ""right one"" isn't going to change anything.</p>  <p>But for people like Sandra Mellott, the questions just keep on rolling in from friends, family and loved ones who may mean well but don't understand what it's like to identify as asexual.</p>  <p>In a society historically centered around romantic pairings and increasingly bombarded by raunchy imagery, people who don't experience sexual attraction can often feel isolated, invisible and misunderstood. But now a growing number of asexual people are banding together in solidarity and support, finding like-hearted souls in a culture where ""happily (and hornily) ever after"" is the end goal.</p>  <p>Most people likely haven't heard the word ""asexual"" since their high school biology class, where it was used to describe plants that reproduce without a second parent. When it comes to people, however, the term can encompass a vast array of experiences.</p>  <p>At its root, asexuality is an orientation defined by the lack of sexual attraction to other people. But humans are complicated creatures, and it only branches out from there. This is not about self-imposed celibacy. Asexual people can identify as gay, straight, bisexual or none of the above.</p>  <p>Intersex dating: Finding love across the intersection</p>  <p>Some, like Mellott, are aromantic to varying degrees and have little to no emotionally romantic attraction to other people. They may still experience and desire intense friendship bonds, crushes, or ""squishes"" -- which Asexuality.org defines as the platonic equivalent of a romantic crush.</p>  <p>Some have romantic feelings, but are satisfied with cuddling, hand-holding and proximity. Still others experience waxing and waning degrees and frequency of sexual attraction, drive and pleasure, thus finding themselves on what's called the ""gray-A"" spectrum, depending upon the circumstances and parties involved.</p>  <p>An ongoing meme in online asexual circles is that even if someone isn't interested in sex, there's always cake, and who doesn't like that? Images of cake are often used to welcome new members or reward them for various life victories online and off.</p>  <p>The community is not without a strong sense of humor and warmth -- but it's not always met with a tremendous degree of understanding from people wired since birth to believe that pair bonding is the end-all, be-all.</p>  <p>Mellott, a writer and victim advocate at a Montana shelter, has always known that she was asexual and aromantic, but has often struggled to get the people around her to accept it as fact. At age 5 she got her first boyfriend, and promptly forgot, neglecting to write the love poem they had agreed to exchange the next day. At 10, she braced herself for questions from adults wondering if she had a boyfriend yet, rehearsing the answer, ""I don't want one; I'm just not interested.""</p>  <p>At 13, a quick Internet search for ""asexual"" confirmed to her that she wasn't alone. At 18, she casually came out to a female classmate who thought it was ""the coolest thing ever,"" and at 21, to a male classmate who tried to ""help"" her by suggesting masturbation.</p>  <p>At 25, she came out to her family, confirming what she thought they probably knew, and letting them know she was at peace with it. ""This is a permanent part of who I am, and I'm proud and confident about it.""</p>  <p>Mellott says her mother was loving and supportive -- and entirely baffled.</p>  <p>""She understands what I'm saying but just can't comprehend how it's possible herself,"" Mellott says. ""So she asks these 'really, not ever?' kind of questions that aren't malicious but get tiring, mostly because they're coming from someone who I love and want to just accept and understand me without all this extra effort.""</p>  <p>What not to say to a transgender person</p>  <p>And then there are the men who treat her as a potential sexual conquest. ""Sometimes I think they take my orientation as some kind of personal attack and they can get really hostile about it,"" she says.</p>  <p>Megan Allen, who works as a health care professional in a town outside of Seattle, has known all her 21 years that sexual attraction just wasn't in the cards for her. She identifies as a repulsed asexual -- a person for whom the idea of sexual contact is simply disgusting.</p>  <p>""All of those bodily fluids and being in such a vulnerable position, and the diseases it could cause, and just... eww,"" she says.</p>  <p>It's not a prudishness on her part; she's done her due diligence on the matter, even to the point of being involved in a nudist colony. There was an ""actual psych test to join that proves you're not there to be a pervert,"" she says. ""So I've seen it all.""</p>  <p>But she, too, knew from an early age that some activities simply aren't an option for her, and that it might limit her prospects for partnership. ""Because of my complete unwillingness to compromise on sex, I'm sort of limited on my dating options,"" she realizes.</p>  <p>Other asexuals, the impotent, people willing to confine their sexual encounters to either self-gratification or a mistress Allen approves would be the only viable solutions, she says. ""Obviously, the last two would put quite a strain on any relationship.""</p>  <p>But she's more open about herself these days than she was in the past -- even placing a bet with several family members who don't believe that her orientation is set in stone. ""I tried to discuss this with my sister once, and with my parents,"" Allen says.</p>  <p>""Both proceeded to make bets with me that I would change my mind someday. I put it in writing both times, they're in my dad's safe. In about nine years, it'll be fun to collect the hundred dollars.""</p>  <p>And she hopes that by that point, the public's attitudes toward asexual people will have changed. ""I wish the public knew that we exist and we aren't 'sick' or 'wrong'"" she says. ""I also wish the LGBTQ community would just get over themselves and accept us ... we're awfully isolated and little-known.""</p>  <p>They're also not putting up with being pathologized. The Asexual Visibility and Education Network hosts a large online asexual community and resource site, and acts as a force for social acceptance and change.</p>  <p>When criteria for the most recent updates to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was being considered, an AVEN DSM Task Force presented the American Psychiatric Association's committee with a 75-page document containing academic research concluding that asexuals should not be included under the diagnosis of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. Instead, they argued, asexuality should be considered an identity rather than a dysfunction.</p>  <p>It worked. In the DSM-5, an absent or diminished sex drive is considered a disorder or dysfunction only if it's caused significant distress to the person -- not if they have self-identified as asexual.</p>  <p>This may not seem like much to the general public, but it means the world to people who may have spent their lives feeling marginalized and ashamed for not experiencing the feelings that are central to so many societal customs.</p>  <p>Photos: Asexuals tell their stories</p>  <p>Gray, a 29-year-old Oregon man who identifies as ""grey-A or greysexual,"" always knew that he didn't quite fit into the dating roles he saw acted out around him. While he considered himself heterosexual and had romantic, sexual relationship with women, after one particular breakup, he just felt ""different.""</p>  <p>""My ex proudly claimed she 'broke' me,"" Gray says. ""And some of my so-called-friends silently agreed.""</p>  <p>Unwilling to settle for that diagnosis (and confident he wasn't gay, as some around him suggested) he looked for answers. He found them in the form of a YouTube video on asexuality that appeared by chance in his feed. He contacted the uploader who answered all his questions, and counseled him that ""sexuality is something that's fluid, and can change over time.""</p>  <p>This validation and acceptance comes in handy in challenging times, such as when people are trying to convince him that he's in denial or confused.</p>  <p>""One woman I came out to tried to convince me that I'm not actually asexual, but I'm actually a magical psychic who isn't attracted to anyone because I was subconsciously searching for the woman I'm meant to be with,"" says Gray. ""This is essentially what many others have tried to tell me: 'You're not asexual, you just haven't met the right person yet.' Only this woman was also making me out to be Harry Potter.""</p>  <p>Ellie Carlin, a 20-year-old Ohio resident who identifies as a hetero-romantic asexual, sees the Internet as a catalyst for this change. She considers herself lucky for stumbling across AVEN at age 17 and finding that she wasn't alone, but she realizes that older asexuals didn't have the benefit of this information and communication when they were coming of age.</p>  <p>""Before the advancement of technology I believe many who now identify as asexual knew they were somehow different from their peers but never truly understood themselves,"" Carlin says. ""However since the founding of AVEN and its website, many asexuals have gathered to better understand themselves. It was finally a place where you realized you weren't alone, nor were you a freak.""</p>  <p>""There are older asexuals as well in the community. I've found that they themselves had not realized they were asexuals until the existence of the Internet. Many of them had sexual experiences, and even had children. They seemed to think there was either something wrong with them medically, or they just figured sex wasn't as good as it was hyped to be,"" Carlin says.</p>  <p>Older asexuals say they have begun to find self-acceptance and share their experiences with younger people who are just beginning to understand their sexual identity.</p>  <p>For 32-year-old Arkansas resident Heather Runyan, seeing her experiences mirrored in other people's -- even those she will never meet -- has gone a long way toward making her feel normal. At age 30, she typed ""asexual"" into a search engine on whim and found AVEN. It was a turning point for her.</p>  <p>""For a long time I thought I was a late bloomer,"" Runyan says. ""I thought that I should feel attraction, but I didn't, so I felt like I was broken. When people asked, I just told them I was happy single and didn't feel the need to date. In my head, I often referred to myself as asexual, but I didn't realize that it was a valid orientation."" She now identifies as aromantic asexual.</p>  <p>Runyan counts herself lucky to have the support of her family, especially her mother.

""I feel very fortunate because I know that many people face pressure to date and get married.""</p>  <p>Still, she believes the public could stand to be more educated about the asexuals who live among them.</p>  <p>""We exist. That may sound simple, but too often when someone says they are asexual, the first response from others is to deny or question it,"" Runyan says. ""It also sends the message that there is something wrong with us. I do not need to be fixed or cured, I am asexual and that's OK.""</p>  <p>Mellott agrees. So far as she is concerned, it doesn't matter whether other people totally understand, as long as they show some respect.</p>  <p>As she put it in a 2013 Tumblr post : ""The point is, don't make assumptions, and don't challenge people when they don't behave how you expect. Actually, there's a nice asexual T-shirt that sums this up: 'When you say I'm confused about my sexuality, what you mean is you're confused about my sexuality.' And really, that goes for all sexualities. Thoughts to ponder.""</p>  <p>For asexuals all over the spectrum, that kind of respect would really take the cake.</p> "

Gooden said she married her husband after he hit her because she loved him -- and, she wanted to ""protect"" him.</p>  <p>""I was thinking about him and not myself, and I think that's the story of a lot of people out there,"" she said.</p>  <p>""The hashtag shows that there are people out there who have lived this, and like me, have come out of this.""</p>  <p>By Tuesday afternoon, the hashtag had been used more than 46,000 times, according to Web analytics tool Topsy, captivating participants and observers alike.</p>  <p>The tweets came in response to stark footage showing Rice knocking out Janay Palmer in February in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, hotel elevator. The video shows him knocking her to the floor and then dragging her unconscious body out of the elevator.</p>  <p>Why I stayed: My domestic abuse story</p>  <p>The couple went forward with their plans to marry. Rice underwent pretrial diversion instead of facing criminal charges, and the NFL suspended him for two games -- a punishment criticized by many as too lenient.</p>  <p>But the incident returned to the the spotlight Monday with the release of the elevator video. Amid the public outcry, people began asking questions about Janay Rice's motivations. Why didn't she leave? Why did she marry him? Why did she stay?</p>  <p>Janay Rice posted a statement on Instagram on Tuesday defending her husband and criticizing the media and the public for making her family ""relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday.""</p>  <p>And on Twitter, the stories reflected many of the reasons domestic violence victims stay in abusive relationships.</p>  <p>Eventually, people began sharing why they left, in an evolution that added dimension to the conversation, feminist and media critic Jill Filipovic said.</p>  <p>Hashtag campaigns often focus on ""raising awareness"" without providing solutions or activist strategies, Filipovic said.</p>  <p>When it comes to helping women in abusive relationships, we need to understand why they stay in the first place, ""instead of contributing to the stigma of staying by shaking our heads and asking why,"" she said.</p>  <p>If a woman knows that her actions will be picked apart ""she has little incentive to rock the boat and make a change,"" Filipovic said.</p>  <p>""The power of this hashtag is that abuse survivors volunteered the answer to the 'why did she stay?' question so that, hopefully, friends and family members of other survivors won't have to ask they can just provide support.""</p>  <p>The reasons women stay in abusive relationships are ""complex and varied,"" said Sandra Hawken Diaz of Interval House, a Toronto women's shelter.</p>  <p>""Too many people assume that if a woman is in an abusive relationship that she is making a choice to stay, and that she has the power to end the abuse if she just leaves,"" she said. ""We need to begin to understand, support and believe victims -- not blame them.</p>  <p>""Instead of asking why doesn't she just leave, we should be asking different questions when we read those headlines. We should be asking, 'Why is he abusive?' or 'How can we break the cycle of violence?' or 'How can I support her to be safe?'""</p>  <p>Fear is one reason partners stay, especially if children are involved, said Katie Ray-Jones, chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Ray-Jones, who is not connected with the Rice incident, offered some general thoughts on what motivates victims of domestic violence when it comes to staying in the relationship or leaving.</p>  <p>""The fear a woman feels is real. The threats her partner makes are real. When a woman's husband tells her he will kill her if she leaves, she believes that. We all know it is possible, we see the stories on TV and the Internet,"" she said.</p>  <p>In most domestic violence situations, the abusive partner blames the victim and the victim believes it, Ray-Jones said.</p>  <p>""Outside the home, this man appears to be a great man. Many woman describe it as Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde: 'Great guy to everyone else, so I must be the problem,'"" she said.</p>  <p>Ray Rice's fame could have affected his wife's decision-making, Ray-Jones said.</p>  <p>""I can't imagine how Janay Rice may have felt. Fans were blaming her on social media, sportscasters made comments somehow indicating she must have provoked the violence, and then she has to sit next to her abuser and apologize,"" Ray-Jones said, referring to a press conference earlier this year. ""We would never ask a person who was mugged on the street to apologize for walking down the street where their assailant was.""</p>  <p>Love and hope also can play into the dynamic, she said. The abusive partner is not abusive all the time, and the victim sees the person with whom she fell in love.</p>  <p>""Victims remember how it used to be and they see that person throughout the relationship. The abusive partner continues to tell them that they will change, that the abuse will not happen again,"" she said.</p>  <p>""Everyone deserves a relationship that is based on dignity and respect. We want victims to be able to reach out and talk to an advocate so they know they have choices.""</p> "

Web dating is no longer associated with recluses hiding behind a computer screen. In fact, one in 10 Americans has used an online dating site or app, according to a 2013 Pew Research report on online relationships.</p>  <p>With that shift, online dating has branched beyond algorithm-based matches to highly specific sites that can focus on any particular niche (even farmers have their own dating site).</p>  <p>Wanted: A part-time lover</p>  <p>Enter Siren, a dating app created for women by women that puts the ladies in the driver's seat when it comes to shopping for an online connection. Women control who sees their image, who can communicate with them and what type of date to pursue.</p>  <p>CEO Susie Lee and design director Katrina Hess created Siren based on the core principle that ""women needed to control visibility,"" Lee said, meaning the users can give clear signals that they're actually interested and comfortable talking to the suitor of their choice.</p>  <p>As online dating options have grown, Lee noticed that her friends' frustration did, too: With every good introduction often came a slew of lewd ones.</p>  <p>""I just started looking (at online dating options) and very quickly realized how many things are out there and how immediately my 'creepy meter' went up,"" Lee said.</p>  <p>The subject has come to a head as users, particularly women, have started publicizing complaints of unsolicited sexual advances online. The 2013 Pew Research online dating report found that 28% of online daters have been contacted ""in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable,"" with 42% of female online daters experiencing this, compared with 17% of men.</p>  <p>This year, comedian and Cracked writer Alli Reed created the ""world's worst dating profile"" on OkCupid to see how terrible an attractive woman would have to be to stop indecent introductions.</p>  <p>OkCupid set up bad dates in 'an experiment'</p>  <p>With snippets like ""I'm really good at convincing people I'm pregnant"" and ""my parents think I'm in law school so they pay all my bills"" alongside a model's photograph, she still managed to get her fair share of boorish messages.</p>  <p>Artist Anna Gensler went so far as to draw artistic, nude interpretations of the off-color openers she received on Tinder and then sent them back to the sender.</p>  <p>How Tinder picks your next match</p>  <p>Lee says the app is not meant to be the counterpart to the ""He-Man Woman Hater's Club"" but instead a place for women to control their images -- whether because they are in a high-profile position or to simply ward off objectification. Lee likens the visibility functionality to a real-world interaction in which a woman makes eye contact or smiles as a signal of interest to a potential suitor. If the suitor ends up untoward, she can toggle her visibility in the same way she could decline conversation in a social setting.</p>  <p>""The reason isn't necessarily that they needed more power over men; they needed to feel safe and have fun,"" Lee said.</p>  <p>Here's how it works: When a user signs up for Siren, they're prompted to take an in-app photo to ensure that ""you really look and are like your profile,"" Lee said.</p>  <p>Next, the user is prompted with an open-ended ""question of the day."" The female users will see all the men who responded that day; if a woman likes a man's take, she can either choose to make herself visible to him or save his profile to scope out future responses and get a broader sense of his personality.</p>  <p>""You're trying to make strangers less strange, and in order to do that, you have to put something of yourself out there,"" Lee said, adding that she hopes this gives a more complete, up-to-date personality portrait of a user than the typical profile list of likes and dislikes.</p>  <p>On the flip side, a male user will see the female user's answers without seeing a profile picture. If his interest is piqued, he can hit an option to notify Siren. The app acts as a third party, alerting the woman that a user liked her answer and inviting her to check him out. The woman can ultimately decide to make herself visible.</p>  <p>In addition, there's the namesake ""Siren"" call: A woman can express what she wants in real time -- whether it's drinks, a quick walk around the city or an activity hinted at with coy ellipses.</p>  <p>""Siren's touchstones always reference what I discern works in real life,"" Lee said. ""Give women the chance to send subtle cues of interest, men to show off a little of who they are, friends to recommend good men and people to make each other smile.""</p>  <p>Siren is part of a growing trend of apps that aim to take control of the online lechery and worse: Hinge allows users to connect only with mutual friends and third-party connections on Facebook; Willow users must answer questions before showing pictures; Wyldfire allows female users to invite only the men who they would want in the dating pool.</p>  <p>With Siren, there's also a vouching component: Women can forward a man's profile to friends for their opinion; ""wingwomen"" can sign on without a public profile so they can help their friends in their search.</p>  <p>""We're cheering good men on in as many ways as we can,"" Lee said.</p>  <p>In beta testing, she says, some users submitted feedback that the functionality would be nice to have in other gender and sexuality groups, so they're working on a version for the LBGTQ community, as well.</p>  <p>The app will launch its public version this week and will initially focus on the Seattle area, where the startup is based, before expanding nationwide.</p> "

Most of all we're here for the fun,"" says Tommy. The residence also provides a base near his latest business venture. Hilfiger, who sold his fashion label several years ago but remains its principal designer, recently purchased the Raleigh hotel in Miami Beach, and he plans to refurbish the Art Deco gem starting in 2015.</p>  <p>But first he and Dee had their own renovation project to tackle. The house they settled on was a 2007 modern structure, offering some 14,000 square feet. Size was crucial, as the couple coveted space for works from their extensive art collection that had long been held in storage.</p>  <p>Architectural Digest: Isaac Mizrahi's Jaw-Dropping Greenwich Village home</p>  <p>""Our Connecticut home feels very country, with lots of taxidermy, and our place in Mustique has a more British Colonial vibe. We wanted to be able to showcase the colorful large-scale artworks that didn't make sense elsewhere, conceptually or size-wise,"" Dee explains, referring to their trove of Pop and post-Pop treasures by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, and others.</p>  <p>To realize the energetic, art-friendly abode they imagined, the couple turned to Los Angeles interior designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard. Having admired his facility with bold gestures and integrating major art into domestic settings—specifically, his work at the L.A. residence of Elton John and David Furnish—the Hilfigers enlisted Bullard to help conjure a home attuned to the rhythms and colors of Miami.</p>  <p>Architectural Digest: A Modernist Dream House in Southern California</p>  <p>""Tommy and Dee obviously have an incredible sense of fashion, so my job was to translate their vision into interior spaces that feel vibrant and compelling,"" says Bullard. ""Together, we conceived the house as part art gallery and part 1960s--'70s disco madness.""</p>  <p>The designer started by replacing ubiquitous dark-wood paneling and expanses of travertine with clean white walls and new flooring of white-glass tiles to cultivate a pristine aura. For graphic contrast he reclad the central staircase in black marble—a strategy reiterated in the black and white stripes on the kitchen floor. Once the backdrop was set, it was off to the races.</p>  <p>Architectural Digest: Bette Midler's Incredible Penthouse</p>  <p>""I told Martyn, 'If it's not shagadelic or groovy, it's not coming into the house,'"" Dee recounts, describing her criteria for furniture and finishes. True to form, Bullard obliged with a kaleidoscopic array of colors, materials, and furnishings, all deployed in vignettes that scream glamour and sex appeal.</p>  <p>The heart of the home is the voluminous living room, presided over by a monumental collaborative painting by Warhol and Basquiat. Ignoring stale precepts that dictate the isolation of art from decor, Bullard extrapolated the painting's vivid hues in an orgiastic hair-on-hide carpet featuring lavish swirls. He also commissioned reeditions of classic sofas by Vladimir Kagan and side tables by Willy Rizzo to inhabit the space.</p>  <p>See more photos of the Hilfiger's home on ArchDigest.com</p> "

Clean first with a sponge and a solution of 5 drops liquid dish detergent in 2 gallons water, plus a teaspoon of rubbing alcohol for extra shine.</p>  <p>2. After that, using a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter, clean a 1-inch strip at the top of the window.</p>  <p>3.

If yours isn't, set it up to clean while you sleep.</p>  <p>How to:</p>  <p>1. Remove oven racks and submerge them in hot water and liquid or granular dishwasher soap.</p>  <p>2. Soak overnight to cut down on scrubbing. Spray the interior and door with an oven cleaner. (Spread newspapers under the door to protect the floor from drips.)</p>  <p>3.

That's when it's time for a deep cleaning.</p>  <p>How to:</p>  <p>1. Avoid spray-on rug shampoos, which can leave a residue on carpets that attracts dirt and soil, undoing the cleaning process. Instead, opt for a hot-water extraction method (often called steam cleaning), which suctions up dirt with a hot water-based solution.</p>  <p>2. Whether you hire a pro, rent a machine or buy your own unit, this is the most effective way to clean and freshen your carpets. Vacuum to remove surface dirt.</p>  <p>3. Then switch to the carpet steamer. Instead of adding carpet-cleaning detergent to the water in the machine, fill a spray bottle with the solution and spritz directly onto the rug.</p>  <p>4. Lastly, run the cleaner over the carpet using clear water only in the extractor. This limits the dirt-attracting residue often left behind when detergent runs through the machine.</p>  <p>Act fast when there's a rug spill: Absorb liquid with dry paper towels. Drench a clean rag in cold water and place it over the spill.

Wipe down the furniture surface with a damp cloth and then with a dry cotton one.</p>  <p>2. Select paste wax that has a high carnauba content; the natural botanical substance acts as a protectant and won't degrade the finish. Apply in a circular pattern. Leave on for a few minutes.</p>  <p>3. Then, remove with a dry cotton cloth, using long strokes in the direction of the wood grain. When the cotton cloth slides rather than drags, your job is done.</p>  <p>Did you know?

Finish by running a full cycle, using the hot-water setting.</p>  <p>Washer and d ryer: After washing certain whites</p>  <p>Did you know that 60 percent of clothes washers are contaminated with bacteria? As if that weren't enough, underwear can harbor E. coli, and kitchen towels are prime breeding grounds for salmonella and other germs. So be sure to clean your washer and dryer when you wash certain whites! Zap germs by laundering those items separately in hot water (between 140°F and 150°F) and bleach—it's the only way to sanitize both your clothing and the machine.</p>  <p>Bed Pillows: Every three to six months</p>  <p>One study found that 16 species of fungi can live in an average pillow, and the stuffing actually attracts allergy-causing dust mites. So to ensure you're only laying your head down in a clean space, wash your pillows a few times throughout the year.</p>  <p>How to:</p>  <p>1. Use the gentle cycle on your machine, hot water and liquid detergent (powder can leave a residue). Wash two regular-size pillows together to balance the load (king-size ones should go one at a time).</p>  <p>2. Run the rinse cycle twice.</p>  <p>3. Then, to dry them, place pillows in the dryer with two clean tennis balls, and set on low. Polyester-or cotton-filled pillows take one to two hours to dry; down requires two hours or more (check for moistness or clumps by pinching several spots on the pillow.)</p>  <p>Computers: As needed</p>  <p>Computer keyboards harbor five times the bacteria found on the typical toilet seat, according to one study. And 10% of people never clean their keybord—it's time for a change!</p>  <p>How to:</p>  <p>1. To disinfect your desktop, disconnect your keyboard and mouse, then pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol onto a clean rag and wipe down both.</p>  <p>2.

""We play with toys designed for our gender, we play different sports based on gender, we often go to segregated schools.""</p>  <p>Holtom's letter was republished by a handful of news sites and quickly gained traction on social media, where many commenters praised his views as unusually thoughtful for someone his age.</p>  <p>Nicholas Pegg, a British actor and writer, called the letter ""magnificent"" and posted a link to it on Twitter.</p>  <p>Actor-director Samuel West wrote on Twitter that Holtom ""writes the sort of letter you want to read from today's schoolboys, and tomorrow's men.""</p>  <p>Reached Monday via Twitter, Holtom told CNN he is heartened by the response to his words.</p>  <p>""My life hasn't really changed - at the moment things are pretty normal, apart from people giving such great support in response to the letter,"" he said. ""Emma hasn't responded, she doesn't have to. I didn't write it for attention, I just wanted people to know I how I felt.""</p>  <p>Watson's impassioned speech, delivered September 20 as part of her role as a goodwill ambassador for UN Women, drew attention for her remarks about the need for equality and for men to embrace feminism.</p>  <p>It also prompted a minor backlash, including a threat to leak alleged nude photos of the star . The threat was later revealed to be a hoax.</p>  <p>""Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong,"" Watson told the UN. ""It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals.""</p>  <p>In his letter to the Telegraph, Holtom said he agreed with everything Watson said and supports equal rights for women.</p>  <p>""We're lucky to live in a Western world where women can speak out against stereotypes. It's a privilege. Gender equality and feminism is not about 'man-hating' or the idea of 'female supremacy.' It is, by definition, the opposite,"" he wrote.</p>  <p>""The definition of feminism is, 'a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes.' It's pretty simple really, and if you believe in those things, then you're a feminist.""</p>  <p>Holtom also wrote in his letter that he was ""disappointed"" by how ignorant some of his classmates were about the gender issues Watson raised in her speech.</p>  <p>But in a Twitter message Monday to CNN, he said he hadn't encountered many hard feelings so far from schoolmates.</p>  <p>""My classmates have reacted pretty well, it wasn't really about anyone in particular - but I understand that some people could have misinterpreted it,"" he said. ""Overall, everyone I know has been really nice and supportive, it's great that so many people agree. :)""</p>  <p>.</p> "

Even sewage isn't spared and is used in indoor and outdoor treatment cells for food production and landscaping. Leftover 'gray' water is also used to flush toilets.</p>  <p>""We were accused of running sewage through the living room,"" says Reynolds. ""That was scary to people but when you see the pictures of what it looks like, it's no longer scary if you understand it.""</p>  <p>Most modern amenities such as plumbing, heating, power and even internet are provided in a self-sufficient way to change the face of remote living.

""This is a pretty damn nice house."" The Earthships range in price from $250,000 to $1.5 million.</p>  <p>But remote deserts are not the only modus operandi, as Reynolds' company has also built 75 homes across the city of Taos, New Mexico and his designs have gone global.</p>  <p>Earthships have been built across the USA, entered Europe, and relief projects are being developed in Malawi, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Philippines, and New Zealand. Fundraising is taking place for a self-sustaining music school on Easter Island, one of the most remote locations in the world.</p>  <p>But the spread of these ships has not been plain sailing, as their radical design breaks most architectural rules.</p>  <p>Reynolds has battled with local governments about the Earthships meeting structural codes. However, his fights are being won as hundreds of people now live, or use, these uniquely designed buildings around the world.</p>  <p>The company's next goal is to expand from remote living to more self-sufficient cities which would be more affordable and sustainable to build -- an Earthship city.</p>  <p>""If some government or corporation was getting ready to do a city for ten thousand people, they'd spend ten years putting in infrastructure to support that city's power and sewage,"" concludes Reynolds. ""We don't need that: if I had a thousand acres somewhere, and funding, I could start building a city tomorrow.""</p> "

Myriad styles of coffee preparation and presentation combined with selective sourcing allow for unprecedented levels of personal flair. But can individuality truly be achieved at an espresso bar?</p>  <p>One ceremony in particular comes to mind: ""pour-over"" coffee, also known as ""hand pour coffee,"" is a brewing style used to produce a single cup at a time. This method was not concocted behind the bar of any Stumptown or Blue Bottle location; rather it migrated here from the Far East, Japan to be exact.</p>  <p>Quiz: Test your coffee knowledge</p>  <p>It was only adopted by coffee epicures and American roasting companies in the past decade, and the time constraints of many customers have prevented the practice from taking off, especially in grab-and-go-style businesses. The practice gained exponentially more buzz last year when the New York Times examined the origin of the pour-over.</p>  <p>In all, the process takes three to four minutes to complete, and the wait is worth it. The benefits of pour-over compared to other brewing tactics lie in the timing and control in the wrist. Infusing the ground coffee for the correct length of time with a controlled hand will produce a fuller, fruity taste, often accented with floral notes.</p>  <p>Take a minute (or two...or three...) and steep in this beginner's tutorial on brewing a single cup of glorious coffee via the pour-over method.</p>  <p>5 hottest new coffee spots in the U.S.</p>  <p>Supplies you'll need:</p>  <p>Fresh coffee (roasted under two weeks week prior to brewing)</p>  <p>Coffee grinder</p>  <p>Single-cup drip coffee cone (ceramic or glass)</p>  <p>Paper filter to fit</p>  <p>Kettle with a swan-necked spout (for precision pouring)</p>  <p>Gram scale (extremely helpful when beginning)</p>  <p>Coffee cup</p>  <p>Step 1</p>  <p>Select your beans. Single-origin beans, rather than a blend, are preferred with this process because they offer a subtle range of flavors that are region specific. Because it is brewed to order in shops, you can become familiar with the product of various countries by simply ordering a cup from, say a Nicaraguan town, or sample them yourself by purchasing small quantities of beans at a time.</p>  <p>Step 2</p>  <p>Heat water in the kettle and grind coffee to medium-fine ground: finer than auto drip but coarser than what would be used to draw a shot of espresso. A good gauge would be to measure 1.5-2 grams of coffee for every fluid ounce you intend to drink. In this example, we'll consider a 16 ounce cup that will require approximately 30-32 grams of coffee.</p>  <p>Step 3</p>  <p>Fold the edge of the filter or trim away the excess and place in your dripper. Position the dripper on top of the cup.</p>  <p>Step 4</p>  <p>Use kettle to pre-wet the filter with water between 195°F and 205°F; the kettle will reach this temperature after 35-40 seconds after it has been removed from boiling heat. This will prevent a paper taste as well as preheat the cup. Dump water from cup.</p>  <p>Step 5</p>  <p>Place the whole contraption atop a gram scale and tare (zero-out) the scale, so that it can properly measure the amount of water.</p>  <p>Step 6</p>  <p>Pour just enough water over the grounds to cover evenly. Let this sit for 30 to 50 seconds, or until the ""bloom"" has settled. This is called ""pre-infusing"" and it allows carbon dioxide to naturally escape from the coffee.</p>  <p>Step 7</p>  <p>This is where the precision and patience come into play. Begin pouring again very slowly, allowing the water level reach halfway up the cone, for optimal ""extraction"". Continue pouring in a circular motion, working your way out, avoiding pouring directly onto the filter. This should last 40 to 45 seconds.</p>  <p>Pause long enough in order to let the grounds settle, then begin pouring again until the scale has reached about 515 grams in total (Note: grams of water also differs based on grams of coffee).</p>  <p>Step 8</p>  <p>Wait until the stream slows to a drip, remove the filter, dump the grounds and enjoy your well-deserved, home brewed cup of coffee.</p>  <p>Step 9 (Optional)</p>  <p>Complement with a light citrus dessert to further enhance the flavors.</p>  <p>Keep in mind that perfecting the pour-over process is personal. Yes, a particular portion of water will enrich the flavor of the coffee in a specific way, but each individual also maintains a unique palate.</p>  <p>Practice your steady, even pouring technique at intervals that you prefer and you will be just fine, says this barista.</p> "

This time, he snatches frame grabs from videos that were made on cell phones and uploaded to YouTube.</p>  <p>What he ended up with is a jumble of violence, exploitation, joy rides, drugs and other illegal activities. It is a view of a country struggling with a shifting economic and cultural landscape, one where technology can create or amplify crisis and where cyberbullying, revenge porn and ""slut shaming"" have gone viral.</p>  <p>""The range of search terms for the work was huge but largely tied to the broken elements of the American economic spectrum,"" Rickard said. ""The search terms really started with simple city names and evolved.</p>  <p>""I started finding that due to the nature of YouTube, much of what was posted was predatory in nature and I needed to evolve the work to include that dynamic of the 'predatory act.' I determined quickly that 'crackheads' or 'girls passed out' or 'hood fight' were search terms on YouTube that would bring up massive amounts of content that people were uploading.""</p>  <p>Abusive behavior exploited by technology is not a new story, but Rickard becomes a predator among the predators, hunting for images to tell this dark American tale. He said he also used keywords such as ""police harassment,"" ""racial profiling"" and ""gang stalking"" to amass his images.</p>  <p>The book is not a photojournalistic document — the lack of captions and context asks us to create our own narratives. The printed text in the book includes a poem created using comments from YouTube. And the low resolution of the frame grabs mostly protects the identities of the subjects and gives the visceral imagery an impressionistic gloss.</p>  <p>Rickard acknowledged that the images show ""elements of social media and technology that aren't pretty,"" but he said the series is also about YouTube as medium and the way it has become ""a platform where people have a voice — it is an immediate stage with reach.""</p>  <p>He said the intimacy of the medium coming right from someone's hand fascinates him. This point of view simply wouldn't be available to a photographer on the scene. ""I was the stranger in the car, a fly on the wall,"" Rickard said. ""They didn't know I was with them that night.""</p>  <p>He was a silent partner in the flow of data streams that thrive on predatory behavior — both the participants who exploit the vulnerable, and the viewers who encourage them with comments and ""likes.""</p>  <p>""Usually the YouTube posters were looking to get 'hits' or 'likes' from the uploads and trying to get laughs,"" he said. ""In many ways, that dynamic was bringing out acts that were incredibly callous, such as paying people on the street to do pushups or cartwheels or showing the writing of the word 'fag' on the face of a young girl that was passed out. I wanted to try and get at this dynamic itself.""</p>  <p>Rickard found that the streams that were most voluminous tended to be brutal, as though the technology itself was encouraging impulsive and dangerous behavior.</p>  <p>He said ""N.A."" is about our habits surrounding modern technology, but that it also comments on race and poverty. For poverty-stricken African-Americans isolated in deteriorating neighborhoods, the American dream may be an impossibility — the ""N.A."" could stand for ""not applicable"" or perhaps ""need not apply.""</p>  <p>""'N.A.' speaks to an inversion of the American dream, an American facade, an American illusion,"" Rickard said. He said there is ""a chasm that has been built like a fortress as relates to opportunity ... a deep division — economic, geographic, cultural, political — in America that many whites prefer to deny and ignore.""</p>  <p>Rickard hopes the book will be a wake-up call on issues of race, economic injustice and technology, saying, ""It is this America that I see in my mind, not the land of the free.""</p> "

And, of course, open some good wine.</p>  <p>There are scads of tips for grilling steaks out there, but for advice for pan-searing and so on, I got in touch with Thomas Dritsas, executive chef of the Del Frisco's group. Since Del Frisco's New York restaurant alone serves more than 1,000 steaks per day (and the other Del Friscos around the country add another 3,500 or so on top of that), you have to figure the guy knows something about cooking beef.</p>  <p>Food & Wine: 35 Steak Recipes</p>  <p>His tips are as follows:</p>  <p>1. Let the steak get to room temperature before you cook it. This keeps the meat from ""seizing""—the proteins tightening up, leading to a tough steak.</p>  <p>2. Preheat your pan or griddle to 400 degrees. If you don't have a laser thermometer (evidently something executive chefs have; I, like any regular human, do not own one), test the pan by placing a piece of fat on it. It should sizzle and start caramelizing.</p>  <p>3. On a stovetop, don't attempt cuts thicker than one inch. If big ol' Flintstone steaks are your dream, then sear the steak on the stovetop and finish it in a preheated oven.</p>  <p>4. With good beef, salt and pepper are all you really need. And a light coating of olive or canola oil.</p>  <p>5. After cooking, let the steak rest for three to five minutes on a perforated surface, like a cooling rack on a pan or even crumpled-up aluminum foil. You don't want the steak to sit in its juices, because that might lessen the glory of that seared crust you just achieved.</p>  <p>Then, of course, eat the dang thing.</p>  <p>Food & Wine: Delicious Steak Sandwiches</p>  <p>Which brings us to wine. What is the perfect steak wine, anyway? On a similar tack, I canvassed a number of notable sommeliers for their vision of the perfect (medium-rare, seared) steak wine.</p>  <p>Laura Maniec, a master sommelier who owns the Corkbuzz wine bars, immediately said, ""Old World northern Rhône Syrah. Yum!""</p>  <p>That sentiment was echoed by Jordan Salcito, who directs the wine programs for all of chef David Chang's restaurants. ""Cornas in particular,"" she added.</p>  <p>Food & Wine: 32 Burger Recipes</p>  <p>Getting even more specific, Carlton McCoy, head of the wine program at Aspen's Element 47 in the Little Nell Hotel, says, ""Northern Rhône Syrah from a structured vintage with 15 to 20 years of age."" Which, I have to admit, sounds mighty darn fantastic.</p>  <p>Others leaned Italian: Jeff Porter, who runs the wine program for NYC's Del Posto restaurant, replied, ""Sangiovese, Sangiovese, Sangiovese—Brunello with a medium-rare steak. Can't beat it!""</p>  <p>The Brunello approach was shared by Steven Grubbs, wine director for star chef Hugh Acheson's restaurants: ""Traditional-style Brunello, all day long.""</p>  <p>Kelli White, codirector of the wine program at Napa Valley's Press restaurant, stuck closer to home: ""I like a savory red with some structure and guts to it. Nothing too fruity, and nothing too oaky either—an American Cabernet with some age, let's say.""</p>  <p>Food & Wine: Best Bacon Burgers in the U.S.</p>  <p>What all of these choices share are a substantial tannic structure, reasonably high acidity (perhaps somewhat less so for the Napa wine) and a balance of savory and fruity flavors. This all makes sense: One reason biting into a juicy piece of beef is so pleasurable is the fat content (very few people ask for a dried-out, super-lean steak, and for good reason). Tannins—which can give big red wines an astringent, tongue-drying, raspy quality—do two things in your mouth: they bind with proteins, and their astringent character balances out all that rich fat.</p>  <p>Acidity, similarly, refreshes your palate after a bite of something fatty; that's one reason that super-fruity, low-acid reds actually aren't all that great with a steak, sort of the way Welch's grape juice wouldn't be.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, not everyone can afford (or can raid their restaurant's cellars for) top northern Rhône reds, superstar Brunellos or long-cellared American Cabernets. But, conveniently, all of these regions offer more affordable alternatives.</p>  <p>Food & Wine: Hot Melted Sandwiches</p>  <p>Here are a few: all, also, out-of-control great with a juicy steak.</p>  <p>2010 E. Guigal Côtes du Rhône ($13)</p>  <p>Most Côtes du Rhône is based on Grenache, but Guigal, known for its great Côte-Rôties, focuses much more on Syrah. This spicy, inky red definitely hews to the northern Rhône style.</p>  <p>2012 Château de Saint Cosme Côtes du Rhône ($15)</p>  <p>Another nearly 100 percent Syrah wine from this usually Grenache-based appellation, Saint Cosme's bottling has a lot of meaty depth and distinct herbal notes.</p>  <p>2012 Louis Martini Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon ($20)</p>  <p>There's ripe California fruit here, to be sure, but it's balanced by classic Cabernet structure and elegance. And—given how much Martini makes of it—this wine is also surprisingly ageable.</p>  <p>2012 Casanova di Neri Rosso di Montalcino ($20)</p>  <p>The baby brother, so to speak, to the more famous Brunello di Montalcino, Rosso di Montalcino comes from exactly the same area, and requires less aging before release. Think vivid cherry fruit, firm structure and juicy acidity.</p>  <p>2011 Mastrojanni Rosso di Montalcino ($25)</p>  <p>This impressive property, owned by the same family that owns the Illy espresso company, produces top-flight Brunellos, and also this ruby-hued, vivid Rosso.</p>  <p>Editor's note: We beg to differ about grilling season being over!

That's how my parents found out that I was a little person, a dwarf, of short stature. They were shocked and upset, knowing that my life would be hard. My maternal grandfather told my mother, ""I don't care how tall she is, she's my first granddaughter, and she's pretty. ""</p>  <p>They didn't find out I had achondroplastic dwarfism until a few months later. ""Achondroplasia"" is a word that haunted me in my childhood. I never wanted to hear it. It wasn't who I was. I was not different.</p>  <p>According to a 2009 report by Richard M. Pauli from the Midwest Regional Bone Dysplasia Clinics, achondroplasia happens 1 in every 25,000 births. It doesn't really matter how often it happens, we happened, and we're here.</p>  <p>My brother is as big as I am small and has been my protector from day one. He made it possible for me to live whatever life I choose. My parents grew up during the civil rights movement. They and their siblings were the only black kids at their respective Catholic schools in middle America. They were treated as subpar. While they were allowed in, they weren't allowed to fully participate. They were denied equal treatment. The indignities they endured are too many to list. My parents made sure my brother and I participated in whatever we wanted.</p>  <p>My family cares for me and at the same time has never shielded me from the world. That's how they raised me. I am Cara. Expectations are not lowered. We can talk about it whenever I need to, but I have not been allowed to hide.</p>  <p>Attack of the 4'2"" chef</p>  <p>Even so, living as a little person is like being the main attraction at the circus every day of my life. Going grocery shopping, getting tampons at the drugstore -- it's like being a celebrity, and the whole world is my paparazzi. The tag line of my blog, Infamously Short , is ""celebrity without fame or money,"" and that's pretty accurate.</p>  <p>I don't believe anonymity is achievable for me. That can make a person a little crazy. And angry.</p>  <p>When I was a child, I used to walk into public places and scan the room to figure out who would be the first to say something. Inevitably, they did. Most of the time it was ""Isn't she cute?"" But sometimes it was more cruel. Deeper. Darker.</p>  <p>They hold their hands over their mouths and laugh, trying to look away but also alert their friends. They whisper, ""There's a midget.""</p>  <p>When I make eye contact, they look away and try to hold in their laughter. I can read lips. It's from a lifetime of watching people mouth ""midget."" There are times when they don't even pretend to hide their ridicule. Walking in a mall, I pass a store. Someone spots me and then brings their whole family to stand in the store window to laugh and jeer.</p>  <p>My existence is a joke to them. When these people refer to little people, they often say, ""Look at it.""</p>  <p>Little people, big top</p>  <p>To them, I am not even human. I'm a different species. It's even used in a clinical capacity. In medical journals, the language is something like ""this male dwarf."" Do they say ""this male autistic"" or ""this female cerebral palsy""? The answer is no, it's always ""this person"" with ""fill in the condition.""</p>  <p>When I was a child, I used to internalize the torment. Outwardly, I was stoic. I pretended it wasn't happening. Inside, I was crying and wishing I was someone else. It shaped how I felt about myself. I was often the target of bullies in school and felt prejudice from some of my teachers. They never outwardly said anything, but they made it difficult to participate in activities. I also had some wonderful teachers who cheered me on, even when I was being lazy.</p>  <p>I played basketball in grade school, not very well, but I tried. The coach, Mr. Sweeney, worked out plays so that I could score. I took dance, something to which I was much more suited. Mrs. Wren required I work as hard or harder as the other girls. She showed me how to be graceful in a body that is typically not regarded as graceful.</p>  <p>I have always been a bit of a drifter searching for a new adventure. When I was 12, I went to India, and it changed my life. I was gone almost a month and was at least three travel days away from my parents. I was scared, exhilarated and free. That trip set the tone for my life.</p>  <p>From the age of 18 to 27, I lived in six cities and moved eight times. During that time, I got three degrees: in political science, theater and photography. I couldn't decide what I wanted to be when I grew up -- or, more accurately, I had a hard time figuring out what the world would allow me to be. When I moved to New York to start work as a photographer, I finally had to face why I had been running: I am a little person.</p>  <p>Manila's little people seek their own community</p>  <p>Coming to terms with being a little person has been a long process, complicated by the world's prejudice. I don't wake up every morning and think ""Oh, woe is me, I am a little person."" I wake up and get on with my day. (My first thought is usually ""Oh, no, I am late again."") I fly out of the house in whatever outfit I have cobbled together, grab breakfast at the bodega and check my email while rushing to the subway. As each moment passes, I calculate how many minutes I am going to be late.</p>  <p>But, like a kick in the chest, I am startled, because someone interrupts my morning routine by pointing, laughing or taking a picture. I am no longer just Cara, the free-spirited comedian who has trouble getting to work on time. I am the little person who deserves ridicule. I'm late to work, running with a body that doesn't have the greatest leg span, praying that the A train is working, and now I have to interact with someone who thinks my mere existence on this planet is a joke. It's a fantastic way to start a day.</p>  <p>Within the past 10 years, I have stopped internalizing my anger and started directing it outward, where it belongs. Why should I put up with the taunting, the picture-taking, the inappropriate sexual propositions on a daily basis just because I am different externally? The answer is: I shouldn't.</p>  <p>I have different levels of response to people's reactions.</p>  <p>If someone laughs, I ask, ""What's funny?"" Most of the time people say, ""Nothing, nothing,"" and then run off in embarrassment.</p>  <p>If people use the word ""midget,"" I say, ""It's called dwarfism. Don't use that word.""</p>  <p>Then there are the sexual deviants. Men approach me in the street and start conversations with ""I want to try it. Sex with you would be different.""</p>  <p>I yell back, ""I am not a sampler platter, no."" They respond with an indignant ""I just want to try it. It would be fun. You don't have to get nasty.""</p>  <p>That's what I hear whenever I defend myself. Apparently, I am supposed to take it. I am supposed to suck it up.</p>  <p>One of my friends says, ""Cara is always trying to prove she's normal."" I am normal. I have the same thoughts, feelings and desires. The world treats me as if there is something wrong with me. It took me a while not to trust the world's opinion.</p>  <p></p> "

Questions such as: ""How many times have you had sex?"" and ""With how many different people have you had sex?"" raised privacy concerns among students.</p>  <p>Clemson junior Machaella Reisman said she appreciates the school's efforts to educate the community on sexual violence prevention, especially in light of recent headlines related to domestic violence in the NFL. But, schools should be able to educate students without asking how many times they've had sex in the past three months, or if drugs or alcohol were involved, Reisman said.</p>  <p>""This is not information that I discuss with my friends, let alone information I feel the need to disclose to the school or whoever the third-party source may be,"" Reisman, 20, told CNN in an email. ""As a questionnaire that is supposed to serve the purpose of educating students on gender equality to prevent sexual violence, why should there be questions regarding how much sex a student has had and if they used drugs, alcohol, or a condom?""</p>  <p>The controversy comes as schools across the country are experimenting with new approaches to sexual harassment prevention and education to comply with federal law. Sexual violence prevention in higher education has been a concern for schools across the country amid widespread allegations that schools mishandled sexual misconduct incidents in violation of federal law.</p>  <p>Mandatory sexual violence education programming is common in schools nationwide. The University of California-Berkeley said this week that at least 500 freshmen could face holds on spring registration if they do not complete mandatory sexual harassment training this semester .</p>  <p>The White House launched a task force earlier this year dedicated to the issue, and unveiled a new public awareness and education campaign on Friday called ""It's On Us."" The program, which President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden announced Friday, aims to engage students and colleges to take active roles in preventing sexual assault on campus.</p>  <p>Clemson's Title IX training module was stirring debate on campus as more people started taking it, Reisman said. A Campus Reform article on the program brought the conversation to the national level, prompting Clemson to suspend the program Wednesday pending further ""review and revision.""</p>  <p>""We felt it was important to take those concerns seriously,"" Shannon Finning, dean of students and associate vice president for Student Affairs, told CNN.</p>  <p>""We are very committed to not only meeting federal requirements, but also assuring that we will provide critically important training and education to all members of our community.""</p>  <p>Reisman also questioned the extent to which her responses would be treated anonymously considering she used her name and student ID number to register for the online course. But Finning said the responses were ""captured anonymously"" and would not be identifiable by the school or CampusClarity, the vendor that created the module.</p>  <p>""At the conclusion, we would gather it in aggregate and it would give us a better picture of campus culture and give us an opportunity to identify additional educational and training needs.""</p>  <p>The questions were included among other slides related to campus resources and exercises in how to deal with potential scenarios, Finning said. On the whole, the course was intended to address requirements under Title IX to make students aware of resources for dealing with sexual violence and how to report sexual misconduct, she said.</p>  <p>Schools that receive federal funding are required under the Violence Against Women Act to provide sexual violence education to new and returning students and employees. Guidance under Title IX issued by the Office for Civil Rights in 2001 and 2014 also makes clear that schools should be providing educational programs on sexual violence to their student body, said Nancy Chi Cantalupo with the professional group Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education.</p>  <p>Surveys are not required by Title IX and VAWA, and schools do not have to purchase surveys or educational programs from third parties, Cantalupo said. There are several models schools can adapt, including White House guidelines .</p>  <p>""By designing their own survey, schools can insure that the survey questions are non-invasive"" Cantalupo said.</p> "

Its specialty? Mellow Chesapeake oysters, from medium-bodied to plump.</p>  <p>Travel+ Leisure: America's Best Fall Color Drives</p>  <p>While it's possible to ship the bivalves across the country, there's nothing better than tasting them freshly plucked from the water. Seafood lovers can safely get their oyster fix during months that don't end in ""r"" thanks to modern refrigeration.

(Spawning summer oysters are usually less flavorful than their winter counterparts.)</p>  <p>Travel+ Leisure: America's Best Chili</p>  <p>Oyster bars and street carts were popularized in the 19th century, when the mollusks grew in abundance and were considered an everyday food. You'll find that kind of casual vibe at southern spots like the Original Oyster House in Mobile, Alabama, and at a growing number of waterfront bars connected to oyster farms.</p>  <p>But our cross-country survey also turned up restaurants that take a more stylish approach. You could spend a romantic evening slurping bivalves at Seattle's bistro-like the Walrus and the Carpenter . Oysters are a natural aphrodisiac, and these bars are sure to tickle your fancy.</p>  <p>Travel+ Leisure: World's Coolest Playgrounds</p>  <p>Hog Island Oyster Company : San Francisco, California</p>  <p>Located inside the Ferry Building, this airy, recently expanded oyster bar provides sweeping waterfront views of the Bay Bridge along with the company's fresh shellfish pulled from nearby Tomales Bay. Chef Christopher Laramie's menu features sustainably raised seafood like steamed Manila clams or semolina-dusted crispy smelts. Much of the produce is grown near the oyster farm.</p>  <p>The Ordinary : Charleston, South Carolina</p>  <p>Chef Mike Lata focuses on East Coast oysters with a sprinkling of choices from the West Coast at this former bank building turned sleek seafood hall. ""We have several oysters that we can get locally and two within an arm's reach,"" he explains, ""and I like to serve them side by side to highlight their differences."" Wild Caper's Blades oysters from South Carolina are available at the white tiled raw bar; pickled shrimp or poached razor clams, served cold with an apple cilantro and jalapeño sauce, are another menu favorite.</p>  <p>Gilhooley's Raw Bar : San Leon, Texas</p>  <p>This cash-only dive's specialty is Oysters Gilhooley, and it makes a persuasive case that the best oyster cookery comes from the Gulf region. Shucked oysters on the half shell are dotted with butter and hot sauce, dusted with Parmesan cheese, and then wood-roasted until browned. While the dish is a year-round hit, the raw shellfish pulled from Texas waters are best enjoyed in season during the colder months.</p>  <p>Matunuck Oyster Bar : South Kingstown, Rhode island</p>  <p>As an extension of Matunuck Oyster Farm, this seafood restaurant overlooks the estuary where the shellfish grow. After studying aquaculture at nearby University of Rhode Island, owner Perry Raso started farming oysters, eventually opening a place for diners to enjoy them. ""We pride ourselves on doing clam shack fare, as well as more refined options,"" explains Raso. While Matunuck's own steely oysters served raw on the half shell are the focus, the bar also serves a few other varieties from the smallest state, side by side to highlight their subtle variations in flavor.</p>  <p>Taylor Shellfish Samish Farm Store : Bow, Washington</p>  <p>Family-owned Taylor Shellfish Farms already operates three oyster bar locations in Seattle, but the best ambience is found at its farm store 90 minutes north of the city. A day trip to this bay-side shack, tucked into the tall pine trees and rocky terrain, is ideal during the warmer months of the year. It provides little more than picnic tables and grills. Eaters are encouraged to shuck their own Shigokus and Kumamotos, but the store's employees will do it for a small fee.</p>  <p>Island Creek Oyster Bar : Boston, Massachusetts</p>  <p>Are oysters aphrodisiacs? This is the place to find out, as Island Creek happens to be one of America's most romantic restaurants. The muted color palette and massive wall of cages filled with oyster shells were inspired by the sunset over nearby Duxbury Bay—the location of owner Skip Bennett's oyster farm. He and chef Jeremy Sewall highlight its bounty, along with shellfish from several nearby sources, and work closely with fishermen and farmers to secure local ingredients. The menu credits fellow oyster farmers like Don Wilkinson of Plymouth, Scott and Tina Laurie of Barnstable, and other purveyors by name.</p>  <p>Grand Central Oyster Bar : New York City</p>  <p>This institution within Grand Central Terminal serves about 2 million oysters annually to suited businessmen and tourists beneath its vaulted tiled ceilings. Open since 1913, the swanky bar has featured bivalves from all over the Western Hemisphere; a sign above the long wooden bar lists the day's particular varieties. Its famed oyster pan roast, with gently cooked Blue Points floating in a cream sauce with chile and paprika, is one of the longest-running menu items in New York City.</p>  <p>Merroir : Topping, Virginia</p>  <p>It's worth the hour-long drive from Richmond just to soak up this restaurant's view of the Rappahannock River flowing into the Chesapeake Bay. Merroir is linked to Travis and Ryan Croxton's Rappahannock Oyster Company , a pioneer in reviving the region's oyster industry after years of environmental degradation. The menu is built around the company's three different oyster varieties—all grown in different parts of the Chesapeake. They vary in salinity and sweetness depending on where they're grown in relation to the mouth of the bay and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>  <p>Eventide Oyster Co. : Portland, Maine</p>  <p>Turquoise walls make a fitting backdrop for this overflowing oyster bar, where stakes in the ice categorize the bivalves as ""from Maine"" or ""away."" The Old Port area restaurant does New England classics like lobster rolls and chowder along with creative offerings like Kim Chee Ice or cucumber ginger.

Gulf oysters arrive at your table on the half shell, either raw or chargrilled.

""He made a mistake -- and he made a very terrible mistake -- but I know the character of the man, and he will rise from this.""</p>  <p>At the Ravens' first game of the season, several fans, including women, wore Rice's No. 27 jersey. One, Lauren Brown, told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront, "" ""He is human and people make mistakes.""</p>  <p>What it will take for the larger public to agree with that sentiment and forgive Rice comes down to two questions, according to Patrick Wanis , a human behavior expert. ""One (is) how much do we actually like the person already? The second is what did we just see? If we see the results of the beating, we react more harshly,"" Wanis said.</p>  <p>For instance, he points to the condemnation of singer Chris Brown after the photo of Rihanna's bloody face surfaced.

He decided to start the club after taking note of the area's growing beer scene -- and discovering that a liquor license was more attainable for a microbrewery.</p>  <p>""I feel I am definitely creating a niche to the market"" Conrad told CNN, adding that he is ""definitely ahead of the curve when it comes to adult entertainment.""</p>  <p>Conrad had no brewing experience going into this venture, but with some trial and error in his garage and help from local craft brewer Toxic Brewing, he is getting some positive feedback on the beer and plenty of support from the area's brewing community.</p>  <p>He describes Pinup Pale Ale, the club's first and only offering, as very approachable, appealing to Bud drinkers as well as craft beer aficionados. However, don't expect to see huge stainless steel fermentation tanks on the brewery tour quite yet though; brewing the beer is something that Conrad takes seriously.</p>  <p>""You gotta get good before you can get creative,"" he said.</p>  <p>Kevin J. Gray assessed the beer for his Dayton City Paper story and noted, ""Pinup Pale Ale was a solid pale ale, a good start on a new system.""</p>  <p>Gray told CNN, ""The Dayton beer scene has exploded in the last two years. Prior to 2012, there were no breweries in the area. Now, Pinups and Pints makes the twelfth microbrewery opening in the greater Dayton area in the last two years.""</p>  <p>Dancers are still the marquee act at Pinups and Pints, but according to Conrad, more and more customers are coming in to check out the beer.</p>  <p>""Those who normally would not go to traditional clubs are starting to come here to try the brew, plus enjoy the entertainment aspect,"" said K.C., a bartender and server at the club. ""Personally, I really enjoy the fact I get to come to work and watch the process and all of the hard work put into each keg,"" she added.</p>  <p>Conrad finds that his main challenge so far is keeping up with the demand for the beer. He puts in many long days brewing in addition to running the club and finds, ""It is a lot of hard work, but I enjoy the challenge.""</p>  <p>Exotic dancers, neon lights and small-batch beers are, so far for Pints and Pinups, a combo just bubbling over with success.</p> "

Two fashion forecasters from WGSN , the official trend sponsor for the sleek affair, weigh in with their predictions.</p>  <p>A strut down memory lan e</p>  <p>As the fashion world looks to spring, designers will be looking back -- particularly to the 1970s -- for inspiration, according to WGSN's head of catwalk, Lizzy Bowring.</p>  <p>If the prospect of a ""Saturday Night Fever"" renaissance seems less than groovy, Bowring assures the retro influence will be subdued.</p>  <p>Caftan comfy, caftan chic</p>  <p>""The idea is to get back into yesteryear but add a contemporary twist with a fresh modern appeal,"" Bowring says.</p>  <p>Pants will take up a slight flare, and just as Diane Keaton notably catapulted menswear into the spotlight in 1977's ""Annie Hall,"" so will the fashion-forward in spring 2015.</p>  <p>Bowring says one of the big themes will be a ""fuss-free approach of androgyny"": Think sleek, sophisticated jumpsuits and/or tailored jackets paired with relaxed wide-leg trousers.</p>  <p>In a similar vein, Jaclyn Jones, WGSN's senior womenswear editor, forecasts that the basic white dress shirt, a wardrobe staple, will be transformed with more dramatic side vents and cuffs, origami folding, embellishments and the like.</p>  <p>Jones also expects a sampling of tent dresses, sometimes referred to as trapeze dresses, to hit the catwalks. (If the garment were laid flat on a surface, its silhouette would gradually flare out from the shoulders and resemble the shape of a tent -- hence the name.)</p>  <p>Both forecasters anticipate a continuation of longer hemlines with midi skirts (skirts that fall midcalf), as well as ankle-length wrap versions, with their waistlines falling at the natural waist versus the hip.</p>  <p>While hemlines are lower, Bowring says there certainly will be no shortage of shorts, particularly of the Bermuda variety.</p>  <p>Straddling that line is one of the most talked-about trends for spring: culottes, a wide-leg, airy, not-quite-shorts, not-quite-pants silhouette.</p>  <p>Keeping it cool</p>  <p>Spring and pastels go together like April showers and May flowers. For 2015, those pastel tones will be washed out and desaturated. In keeping with that, there will also be a ""core neutral story,"" Jones says, with shades of tan, taupe, gray, white and black.</p>  <p>Bowring expects collections will also be brimming with different shades of purple, particularly lilac.</p>  <p>As for patterns, both predict there will be a bouquet of hand-painted florals, including of the Hawaiian theme.</p>  <p>""It's not going to scream 'Hawaiian,' it's going to be more sophisticated and you're going to realize it's a hibiscus flower after,"" Jones says.</p> "

""They want to feel like there's something they can rely on.""</p>  <p>But breaking a ritual brings a similar impact, and that's what happened with Starbucks. People come to rely on these products, Sredl said, and enjoy the feeling of reliance they provide.</p>  <p>This pattern of behavior isn't unusual. During the back-to-school shopping season, which Sredl has studied specifically, shoe-buying often dominates and parents have been known to panic if the shoe or size or price they're hunting is suddenly unavailable.</p>  <p>Consider Christmas. ""Usually in marketing when we think about seasonality, we think about Christmas because it's such a huge retail season. But it's not the retail really — in this case, the pumpkin spice — that created the phenomena,"" Sredl said. ""It's the change of seasons.""</p>  <p>But the craze doesn't stop with caffeine.</p>  <p>Fall for this perfect pumpkin-shaped spice cake</p>  <p>Stan Frankenthaler, Dunkin' Donuts' executive chef, is no stranger to the strong relationship customers build with their seasonal treats — whether it's a new latte or new donut.</p>  <p>Dunkin' got into the pumpkin game about eight years ago, Frankenthaler said, and hasn't stopped. In September, Dunkin' announced new pumpkin-flavored K-Cups, for brewing coffee, alongside pumpkin muffins, donuts and cream cheese.</p>  <p>Annually, the company uses about 100 million pounds of pumpkin puree — with good reason.</p>  <p>""[Customers are] saying 'more pumpkin, more pumpkin, more pumpkin,'"" Frankenthaler said.</p>  <p>More pumpkin is one of the most frequent customer requests, through sites like Facebook, he said. ""And we're saying to ourselves, 'Wow, they love pumpkin that much. What else can we do?'""</p>  <p>It helps that pumpkin has its roots in fall festivities. Both Sredl and Frankenthaler said celebration is a major hook for ritual-making, whether it's celebrating the last day of Christmas or the first day of spring. One reinforces the other.</p>  <p>""Food really is about that in-the-moment celebration,"" Frankenthaler said. ""No one is thinking about eating pumpkin when you're still wearing a bathing suit.""</p> "

And while we like the idea of having something as simple and adaptable as chicken fingers on hand, we wondered if we could stock our freezer with kid-friendly, great-tasting chicken fingers with minimal effort. Here's how we did it.</p>  <p>America's Test Kitchen: The Make-Ahead Cook Book</p>  <p>Brine your bird:</p>  <p>We had a hunch that all those preservatives were helping to keep the chicken moist during the reheat, so we started by thinking about how to keep the chicken as moist as possible. Brining turned out to be the best solution: It makes the chicken very juicy so it doesn't dry out as it cooks. To give our chicken fingers great flavor, we added a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the brine and onion and garlic powder to the breading.</p>  <p>America's Test Kitchen: Farro, White Bean, and Broccoli Rabe Gratin</p>  <p>The crispier, the better:</p>  <p>To get a crisp coating on our chicken even after reheating, we swapped traditional bread crumbs for ultracrisp panko bread crumbs and tried a few different cooking techniques. Deep-frying the chicken fingers was a lot of work for little payoff. Next, we tried to mimic frying by tossing the breading with oil and baking the chicken, but on the reheat the chicken was dry and the coating was sandy. Sautéing turned out to be the winning technique: By the time the breading fried up supercrisp and golden, the chicken was cooked through but still tender and moist, and we avoided all the mess and waste of deep frying.</p>  <p>America's Test Kitchen: Essential Equipment for the Make-Ahead Cook</p>  <p>Storing and cooking:</p>  <p>To store the chicken fingers, simply transfer the cooled chicken to zipper-lock freezer bags, press out air, and seal. They're good for for up to 1 month. To cook, just heat the oven to 350 degrees, place chicken fingers on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until the chicken is heated through and crisp, about 30 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through baking.</p>  <p>America's Test Kitchen: Make-Ahead Stuffed Shells</p>  <p>Chicken Fingers Recipe</p>  <p>(Don't brine the chicken for longer than 30 minutes or it will be too salty.)</p>  <p>Ingredients :</p>  <p>Salt and pepper</p>  <p>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</p>  <p>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed and cut lengthwise into 3/4-inch-wide strips</p>  <p>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</p>  <p>1 tablespoon onion powder</p>  <p>1 teaspoon granulated garlic</p>  <p>3 large eggs</p>  <p>2 cups panko bread crumbs, toasted</p>  <p>3/4 cup vegetable oil</p>  <p>To prep:</p>  <p>1. Dissolve 1 tablespoon salt and Worcestershire in 2 cups cold water in large bowl. Submerge chicken in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>  <p>2. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Combine flour, onion powder, granulated garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper in shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in second shallow dish. Spread panko in third shallow dish. Working in batches, dredge chicken in flour mixture, dip in eggs, then coat with panko, pressing gently to adhere; transfer to large plate.</p>  <p>3. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Heat 1/4 cup oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Lay one-third of chicken in skillet and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared rack and wipe out skillet. Repeat shallow frying twice more with remaining oil and chicken. Let chicken cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</p>  <p>To store:</p>  <p>4. Transfer cooled chicken fingers to zipper-lock freezer bags, press out air, and seal. Freeze for up to 1 month. (Do not thaw before reheating.)</p>  <p>To finish and serve:</p>  <p>5.

""I decided no more violence. I didn't want my son to see him treat me that way.""</p>  <p>She left him two years ago and moved into her own place. She mostly kept the ordeal to herself until she found the courage to express herself in the Monument Quilt, a collection of hundreds of survival stories touring the country this summer.</p>  <p>Her words in Spanish are etched into a 4-foot red square that shares space with others' stories in a 16-foot square. When laid out in full, the squares of 250 stories of surviving rape and abuse stretch out to a 100-foot multicolored square.</p>  <p>""You told me that you loved me but now I know and I understand that I was raped,"" she says.

""It can be solidifying and reassuring. It can be lifting. It's not just on you anymore.""</p>  <p>Part of the healing comes from the collective impact of bearing witness to hundreds of survival stories. It also comes from creating the squares, some of which starts in workshops weeks before the Monument Quilt comes to town.</p>  <p>Force partnered with community-based prevention and public safety organizations, who made the quilt workshops part of their community outreach. South Dakota's White Buffalo Calf Women Society hosted workshops two weeks in advance of the quilt's arrival in White River, where it was displayed at a local high school.</p>  <p>Quilting is a cultural tradition of the Sioux tribe that inhabits the region, making it an ideal project for the community the shelter serves.</p>  <p>""It gave them a voice without putting them in the spotlight and I think that in itself was very powerful, and a good way to start the healing process,"" education outreach coordinator Summer Lunderman said.</p>  <p>""To stand in solidarity not only with our relatives here but with women in the U.S. was also very empowering for them and let them know they're not alone.""</p>  <p>Helping others with their squares brought up memories of Lunderman's experience being molested as a child.

Seeing the diversity of experiences represented in the quilt inspired Keller, who is biracial, to make her own square.</p>  <p>""What I love about the whole project is the narrative of control by survivors,"" she said. ""It speaks to the diversity of different experiences who have gone through abuse and rape because we're the ones sharing those stories in the way we choose.""</p>  <p>Moreno says creating her square was cathartic.

Now, as the end of the season draws near, let's revisit some of the most notable moments from 20 years ago, the summer of 1994.</p>  <p>Inspirational movies reigned supreme, electro-pop and boy bands ruled the radio, and the ""crime of the century"" was the talk of the country. Here's more on the summer that was:</p>  <p>Blockbusters and summer 1994 were like peas and carrots</p>  <p>""The Lion King"" taught moviegoers young and old about the circle of life via the coming-of-age adventure of a young lion cub named Simba.

His name? Forrest, Forrest Gump .</p>  <p>That summer, we also met ""The Flintstones"" in a live-action film that was received poorly by critics but ran the box office for several weekends after its May 27 release date. Thirty-two writers famously worked on the script, but one key line still remained: yabba-dabba-doo!</p>  <p>""The Mask"" was another sssssmokin' late-summer hit: The slapstick comedy starring Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz made more than $23 million on its opening weekend of July 29.</p>  <p>And no summer movie season is complete without an action film -- or three: ""True Lies,"" ""Speed"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" all screeched onto the big screen in the summer of '94.</p>  <p>Soulful and Swedish tune s</p>  <p>Swedish pop group Ace of Base showed no signs of stopping with two hits that summer: ""The Sign"" and ""Don't Turn Around.""</p>  <p>Listeners swore by the soulful harmonies of All-4-One's ""I Swear,"" which dominated the Billboard Hot 100 charts for 11 straight weeks.

With oil prices at a low and interest rates inching upward, the so-called Teflon President seemed virtually assured re-election over Democratic opponent Walter Mondale that November. Americans had been reeling from the loss of 241 Marines after an attack in Beirut, Lebanon, the previous fall, but the swiftly executed invasion of Grenada had reaffirmed the public's faith in Reagan's leadership.</p>  <p>Mondale attempted to keep images of the fallen soldiers (not to mention potential nuclear attack by unspecified foreign forces) fresh in voters' minds, but it was no match for the sunny optimism of Reagan's ad ""America Is Back"" (often known as "" Morning In America ""), which depicted house-buying, flag-waving, fully employed Americans going about their business. Mondale managed only to win his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia in the election.</p>  <p>Music: Private dancing in the dark while doves cry</p>  <p>Let's hear it for the boys. And the girls. And an epic era of movie music. The ""Footloose"" soundtrack, packed with powerhouse hits from Deniece Williams, Kenny Loggins and others, reached its apex right at the beginning of summer '84, but still pumped out of poolside boomboxes throughout the season.</p>  <p>Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and Duran Duran's ""The Reflex"" skipped through the spotlight before the artist formerly and currently known as Prince wrested the top Billboard spot for five consecutive weeks from July to early August with ""When Doves Cry"" from his soundtrack album ""Purple Rain.""</p>  <p>Ray Parker Jr. blasted onto the Billboard Hot 100 in August with a three-week stint in the top spot for his single ""Ghostbusters,"" but who'd he have to call? His lawyer, apparently. Huey Lewis eventually sued the artist for $5 million, citing similarities between the chart topper and his hit ""I Want a New Drug."" The matter later was settled out of court confidentially.</p>  <p>A 20-year-old Courteney Cox swayed onstage with Bruce Springsteen in the video for ""Dancing In the Dark"" -- the first single from his smash-hit album ""Born in the U.S.A."" But it was Tina Turner who capped off the season that September with three weeks in the No. 1 spot for ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" from the album ""Private Dancer."" The song was later used as the title for a film of Turner's life story, and it marked her first Top 10 single since the 1970s -- making her, at 44, the oldest solo chart-topping female artist to date.</p>  <p>Movies: Revenge of the ghostbusting nerd kids</p>  <p>It's easy to wax (on) rhapsodic about the silver screen in the summer of 1984 -- especially if you were an underdog. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis starred as a team of misfit parapsychologists tasked with ridding New York of ghosts and meddlesome gods. The June release of ""Ghostbusters"" slimed the competition at the box office, while Harrison Ford took a wild mine ride into second place with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" after its late May release.</p>  <p>A baby-faced Ralph Macchio leg-swept his way into moviegoers' hearts as ""The Karate Kid"" under the tutelage of handyman/martial arts expert Mr. Miyagi (played by Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita). The Kid stood up to Cobra Kai tyrant Johnny Lawrence, played by William Zabka, who was eternally typecast as the go-to blond bully boy of the era.</p>  <p>In ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" released in July, Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards paired up to play academically inclined freshmen who eventually gain social supremacy over the jockish jerks of the Alpha Beta fraternity by joining forces with other outcasts, panty raiders and nose-pickers.</p>  <p>""Gremlins"" fed moviegoers' appetite for cutesy horror, Patrick Swayze's ""Red Dawn"" became the first release to earn a first PG-13 rating for its ""intensity"" of violence in a fictional post-communist invasion America, and Tom Hanks threw a ""Bachelor Party"" that got a tad out of hand.</p>  <p>Prince's ""Purple Rain"" went crazy at the box office and the record stores, while ""The Natural"" swung for the fences. The ""Star Trek"" franchise found its place among the season's biggest hits with its third installment, ""The Search for Spock""; and the nation's geeks (and probably a jock or two) commenced a collective crush on John Hughes' red-haired muse Molly Ringwald with her breakout role as Samantha in ""Sixteen Candles.""</p>  <p>Olympics: Barefoot, bouncing, Beatrice and bumping into history</p>  <p>The XXIII Olympiad in Los Angeles may have been boycotted by the Soviet bloc, but China made a grand return to the Games after its last outing in 1952, taking home 15 gold medals. Mary Lou Retton (and her iconic bouncy haircut) tumbled her way into history -- and the nation's heart -- by becoming the first American to win the women's all-round gold medal in gymnastics.</p>  <p>Zola Budd was nearly booed off the track as the barefoot South African runner (competing for Great Britain) collided with American runner Mary Decker during the 3,000-meter run for the gold medal, knocking her to the curb and out of competition. American runner Carl Lewis completed his quest to match Jesse Owens' record four gold medals in a Games in 1936, but likely due to controversy over his long jump approach, fell short of the lucrative endorsement goals he'd set for himself.</p>  <p>The televised Games also marked the semi-creepy public reveal of the scope of the "" Beatrice "" brand of products, with an omnipresent commercial campaign showing the range of common household food brands manufactured by the billion-dollar processing company. ""We're Beatrice. You've known us all along,"" the ads said. ""Is that you, Big Brother?"" responded the viewing public.</p>  <p>Street style: Floppy, bright and totally tubular</p>  <p>Big, loose belts, sky-high hair, workout wear, Swatch watches, neon hues, draped scarves and a surprising return to seersucker defined 1984 summer style. The tail end of the old-school hip-hop era ushered in a new wave helmed by New York-centric artists such as Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J, and documented in the film ""Graffiti Rock."" The B-Boy culture of break dancing and graffiti art had been popular in Puerto Rican and African-American youth culture since the 1970s, but suddenly, it seemed as if everyone and their suburban cousin was hauling sheets of cardboard out to the sidewalk and practicing their backspins by the mesquite grill.</p>  <p>TV: It was 1984. Summer was all reruns and Olympics, like, fer sure.</p>  <p>What are your favorite summer memories, from music to fashion?

This allows you to control both the cut and the size of the grind. We opted for thigh meat, as this cut boasts a decent amount of fat and flavor. To solve the moisture issue, we decided to use some of our turkey to make a sausage: Finely processing some of the meat causes the proteins to stretch out and link up into a stronger network that traps fat and moisture. When mixed into the remaining ground turkey, the sausage trapped copious amounts of moisture and fat, resulting in a juicy, tender burger.</p>  <p>We found an unusual remedy to loosen our burgers' texture: raw white mushrooms. Chopped in the food processor and then mixed into our turkey sausage, the mushrooms provided three unique benefits: They increased tenderness; provided extra moisture; and, thanks to their high level of glutamates, helped boost meatiness.</p>  <p>Just five minutes per side over a hot fire was enough to char and cook our mouthwatering turkey burgers, which were now every bit as enticing as the beef version, especially when topped with some malt vinegar-molasses sauce .

Would we find anything to eat that contained absolutely no animal products, or would we be reduced to subsisting on doughy rolls and plain salads?</p>  <p>I'm happy to report that Prague not only surpassed my imagination with its stunning vistas, medieval bridges and palatial grandeur, it turns out to be chock full of fabulous vegan and vegetarian restaurants. In fact, Central Europe in general is a hotbed of vegetarianism. Who knew?</p>  <p>Don't fear the vegan!</p>  <p>It turns out that Happy Cow knew. I have long used the Happy Cow app in the U.S. to find vegan restaurants. But I had low expectations when I clicked on the app in Prague, seeking the closest vegan or vegetarian restaurants. My assumptions were way off. It turns out Prague is a mecca of compassionate living with well over a dozen choices popping up: either vegan, vegetarian or veg-friendly.</p>  <p>Within a 10-minute cobblestone-laden stroll from the historic Charles Bridge, which dates to the 14th century and overlooks the Vltava River, we were delighted to encounter LoVeg , an ironic name given that we climbed three flights of candlelit stairs to get to it. It was worth the hike for the delicious vegan burger made of red beets, chickpeas, tempeh and gherkin. The staff is clearly in it for the cause of compassion, hence their motto: ""We give food a higher meaning."" We liked it so much we came back again and tried the baked beetroot carpaccio.</p>  <p>Next stop: Cesky Krumlov, a storybook medieval city whose historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage site and sits about halfway between Prague and Vienna. Surely, I thought, there's no way we'll find vegan options in this place. Wrong again! This was actually the site of one of our favorite vegetarian restaurants: Laibon .</p>  <p>Sitting on sturdy wooden tables in an open terrace on the banks of the river, we stared up at the famed castle that was started in the 13th century but expanded over time to embrace not just Gothic but Renaissance and Baroque styles. Meanwhile, we nibbled on a vegan sampler for two that included Indian, Mexican and traditional European flavors.</p>  <p>6 veggie burgers so good you won't miss the meat</p>  <p>Our waiter was fluent in several languages, and we even bantered in Spanish for a while. It was a magical blending of cultures and centuries at the crossroads of time and taste.</p>  <p>For a pick-me-up during sightseeing, we sampled the addictive potato swirls sold by a street vendor -- something akin to a medieval order of fries.</p>  <p>For the piece de resistance, it was off to Vienna. Would the home of Mozart and Freud have some compassion in its high culture stew? Ja naturlich! In fact, there were so many vegan options, we hit Eis Greissler , an ice cream store that features several vegan flavors, for a cone of mindblowing vegan chocolate ice cream even before hitting our main meal! Good thing we were walking at least 5 miles a day.</p>  <p>Then, we discovered Makro 1 nestled in a small courtyard just a short walk from the historic St. Stephen's Cathedral in the heart of Vienna. The few outdoor tables were taken, but everyone seated at them generously invited us to join them. When we asked for a menu, a friendly lady in an apron pointed to the chalkboard, and we realized that there was a single offering of the day. So we each ordered the macrobiotic plate that featured sweet sauteed pumpkin, delicious quinoa, lentils and salad. It really felt like we were having a meal with a local family.</p>  <p>We chatted with the others about Veganz , the new vegan supermarket chain sweeping Europe. It made me realize, being vegan is like being a member of a compassionate club where you can find a haven with your fellows anywhere in the world.</p>  <p>All of our vegan adventures were memorable. But the one that will always stand out was our lunch at the sumptuous Tian , a white glove vegetarian restaurant near Vienna's renowned Belvedere Palace.</p>  <p>Using our Gogobot app to find a spot out of the rain, we had no idea we were stepping into the fanciest vegetarian experience of our lives. I'm talking palate cleansers, hand towels and a suggestion to allow at least an hour and a half for the full experience. What a treat: vegan caviar served up in vintage tins, followed by mouth-watering combinations of carefully sculpted vegetables. Finally, our dessert featured perhaps the most succulent brownie I've ever tasted. Donna had strawberry dumplings that were almost too beautiful to eat. Almost. We devoured every last bite.</p>  <p>On our last day, before tackling the massive and astounding Schonbrunn Palace and its sweeping gardens, we filled up at Deli Bluem , which offered a buffet of hearty plant-based dishes from red lentils with millet, apples, spinach and radicchio to eggplant with pomegranate, pine nuts and basil.</p>  <p>Finally, for a last dessert before heading back to low-calorie reality, we hit a small shop on a Vienna side street called Easy Going Bakery . We wanted to find that classic, light Viennese puff pastry, and we did in the form of mini-cupcakes.</p>  <p>Our vegan adventure added so much flavor and excitement to our trip. It got us off the beaten path and into the nooks and crannies where real people live. We got a real taste of what life in Central Europe is really like.</p> "
"257","What's the deal with food recalls?","CNN.com","2014-08-25 16:25:24","2014-10-06 06:07:39","http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/living/clarified-what-is-a-recall-eatocracy/index.html","Living"," <p>Some recalls result from mislabeling (such as undeclared ingredients like shellfish, milk, nuts, eggs or wheat gluten) or improper processing, while other recalled foods were contaminated with listeria, E. coli, salmonella or botulism.</p>  <p>About 48 million people -- 1 in 6 Americans -- contract some form of food poisoning each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths that are, by the federal government's estimations, "" largely preventable .""</p>  <p>At any given time the FDA is responsible for watching over some 167,000 domestic food facilities or farms and another 421,000 facilities or farms outside the United States, according to FDA officials. But there are only about 1,100 inspectors to oversee these facilities, officials told CNN in 2012.</p>  <p>Tainted food and mislabeled food slip through the cracks all the time, and unwitting consumption can result in conditions ranging from stomach discomfort and fever to death from infection and allergic reactions. It's in a food producer's best interest to get a bad product off store shelves and alert consumers as swiftly as possible -- and it's the duty of the federal government to help minimize the risk to public safety.</p>  <p>Often, their best course of collective action is a recall, but what does that actually mean?</p>  <p>Who is looking out for your food safety?</p>  <p>Prior to the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act , the FDA could strongly suggest action, but had no authority to issue a mandatory recall of potentially harmful food. (For example, in the summer of 2010, consumers had to rely on suppliers' voluntary removal of nearly 500 million eggs from the marketplace in order to make sure that store supplies were free of salmonella. Still, an estimated 1,600 people nationwide were sickened by the eggs.)</p>  <p>Since President Obama signed the law into effect in January 2011, there has only been one attempt by the FDA to enforce the mandatory recall of a food item: pet treats that were found to have been tainted with salmonella and allegedly caused several dogs to become ill. (In the end, the company was given a two-day notice to take corrective action -- which it did -- and enforcement wasn't needed.)</p>  <p>But in the interim, hundreds of food items -- including 9 million pounds of adulterated meat , massive quantities of stone fruit and several dozen varieties of peanut butter -- have been voluntarily recalled by their producers.</p>  <p>There are a few ways that can be set in motion. A producer may, through its own internal product testing or customer reports, find that there is an issue with its food and alert the FDA or FSIS. In other cases, testing by these agencies' inspectors may reveal an issue, which is communicated to the company. And in others, local and state health services will contact the CDC, which can identify patterns of foodborne illness using the FoodCORE system and in turn alert the FDA and FSIS.</p>  <p>Foodborne Illness 101</p>  <p>If the product is meat, poultry or egg-based, FSIS can form a committee to determine if a recall is needed. If so, agents collaborate with producers to make sure that the product is no longer available to the public, and that consumers have received adequate warning via the media and the FSIS website about what products are affected and what course of action to take. If a risk is posed, but a recall is not needed, FSIS will issue a public health alert.</p>  <p>The FDA oversees all food that's not under FSIS jurisdiction and will evaluate each case to determine the threat it poses to public safety. In most cases, the agency will work with the producer to take corrective action at the facility level (cleaning machines and workrooms, safely removing contaminated ingredients and the like) and alert the public if needed. All cases are listed on the FDA website , but more severe ones will be communicated to the media via press release.</p>  <p>But if the risk to public safety is found to be particularly high, the Food Safety Modernization Act allows the agency to shut down manufacturing until the threat has been contained. This power was enacted for the first time in November 2012, when a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Bredeney was linked to peanut butter produced by Sunland Inc. The FDA suspended the company's food facility registration, effectively prohibiting it from distributing food. Sunland subsequently declared bankruptcy and shut down production for good.</p>  <p>Both FDA and FSIS use a three-tier classification for the threat posed by the food:</p>  <p>""Class I recall: a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.</p>  <p>""Class II recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.</p>  <p>""Class III recall: a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.""</p>  <p>So how does a reasonable consumer stay apprised of all these goings-on and avoid spending precious time making the rounds of governmental websites on a daily basis?</p>  <p>Follow @FDArecalls on Twitter. The account posts the most recent additions to the recall list, and its sister account, @USDAFoodSafety shares a mix of FSIS recall news and food safety tips.</p>  <p>If RSS is more your speed, the FDA and FSIS both offer newsfeeds, as well as e-mail blasts to keep you on top of your food safety game.</p> "

""WTF"" and ""EEEWWWWW! Is this really salad?""</p>  <p>Seeing as I'm a journalist and all, I took it upon myself to investigate.</p>  <p>The dish was indeed on the salad bar, labeled "" meatloaf salad "" at 50 cents an ounce, and it tasted like cold chunks of decently prepared meatloaf. I posted a picture online and promptly questioned everything I have come to understand about myself and what I know about the world.</p>  <p>Stuff mixed with lettuce, I get that. Various materials held together with mayonnaise, I understand. Fruitstuffs tumbled about with marshmallows and cream, I don't so much dig, but it has been codified as salad for me in the past, so I accept it as such.</p>  <p>But not this.</p>  <p>""You haven't been the same since the meatloaf salad, have you?"" asked one concerned citizen of Instagram. ""No,"" I replied. ""None of us have.""</p>  <p>People, including some who I've never met in real life, have started to present me with documentation of their meals, pleading for verification.</p>  <p>""Does this heap of beans tossed in dressing count as salad? How about this torn-up sandwich thrown on top of a pile of bagged spring mix? What about this meat I mixed with mayonnaise and threw on a lettuce leaf? Is it salad?""</p>  <p>Yes. Yes, it is, and I say this with the backing of several intensive weeks of subsequent salad research that consisted of deep dives into my vintage cookbook library (including but not limited to titles such as ""Favorite Recipes of America: Salads"" from 1968, ""White Trash Cooking"" from 1986, ""Clementine Paddleford's Cook Young Cookbook"" from 1966, ""The Silent Hostess Treasure Book"" from 1930, ""Metropolitan Cook Book"" from 1957 and ""The Art of Serving Food Attractively"" from 1951) and asking a bunch of people on Twitter, ""Does X count as salad?""</p>  <p>After encountering published recipes for Guess What Salad (the ""what"" turns out to be corned beef suspended in lemon gelatin), frankfurter-potato Salad, ham-lima Salad, Macedoine Salad (that's cooked carrots, peas, lima beans and cauliflower in French dressing) and Pink Arctic Freeze couched under the salad rubric and consuming approximately 2,943 research salads in the matter of a few weeks' time, I'm issuing my verdict: Sure. Sure, that counts as salad, if you say so.</p>  <p>I'm not any kind of professional salad-ologist; I'm just a girl standing in front of a stream of Instagrammed and Tweeted and Facebooked bowls of cut-up meat, fruit and lettuce, wondering how my life got to this point.</p>  <p>Do you want it to be salad? Did someone else say ""salad"" at you when they wrote the recipe or put it on the menu? It's salad. I just pointed at my greyhound and told him he was salad, and he sort of grunted and went back to licking himself, so I guess he's salad now, too.</p>  <p>I am salad. You are salad. We are all salad. Let us together collapse into the salad singularity.</p>  <p>Salad.</p>  <p>But, if you want to get fussier about it, here's a rough taxonomy of salads a person might encounter out in the wild.</p>  <p>Standardized salad</p>  <p>These are salads for which there is an accepted ingredient list, though the format may vary. People like to get creative with plating and deconstruction and ""takes"" on these dishes, and hey, that's none of my business. Let your salad flag fly. But this all goes to say that my tuna Nicoise had darn well better include tuna (duh), potatoes, green beans, anchovies, lettuce, hard-boiled egg, tomatoes, olives and a vinaigrette dressing, or don't call it tuna Nicoise.</p>  <p>Likewise, that Caesar needs to have romaine lettuce, croutons and Parmesan cheese doused in a dressing that contains anchovies, or you need to call it something else. Add a modifier if need be: kale Caesar or ""Caesar where we cheaped out on the anchovies"" but please give the classics their due.</p>  <p>These salads include but are not limited to: Caesar, Nicoise, Caprese , horiatiki (Greek), panzanella, Cobb, chef, Lyonnaise, fattoush, ohitashi.</p>  <p>How to make perfect vinaigrette</p>  <p>Tossed salad</p>  <p>Several years ago, I attended a food and culture symposium where a speaker described Charlotte, North Carolina's emerging ethnic enclaves as a ""salad bowl"" rather than a ""melting pot,"" because the people and their businesses merged with the existing population in a mutually beneficial way and yet maintained their distinct identities. Good at lunch, great in life. Have at it.</p>  <p>Chopped salad</p>  <p>Take a tossed salad, make an office worker feel slightly power-mad by giving them some say in the ingredients, dazzle them with a little forceful mezzaluna action, and you shall capture their affection -- mind, mouth and wallet -- for all of eternity. Yes, you, Just Salad, Chop't, Saladworks and the rest of the Big Salad cabal. And would it be easier if I just gave you my bank's routing number?</p>  <p>Composed salad</p>  <p>Well, aren't you fancy? Someone has plated the salad in a particular way, maybe with a little ring of crab atop it or some frizzled onions placed just so. There is art to this thing, it's usually already dressed -- drizzled, even, and arranged for maximum aesthetic delight and flavor interplay -- so you just dig in and savor, ya hear?</p>  <p>Various chain restaurants and celebrity chefs have also made additions to the modern composed salad canon with their signature takes on the Chinese chicken salad, Southwest salad and others. We thank you for your contributions to the genre.</p>  <p>Should the composed salad making spirit happen to overcome you at home, chef and local food evangelist Alice Waters once wrote that she has but one rule: ""As for what to include in such a salad and how to dress it, taste each ingredient before you decide."" Alice Waters gets way better vegetables than you do.</p>  <p>Green salad</p>  <p>There are greens. They are dressed. Perhaps there is a shaving of cheese and possibly a carrot shred or cherry tomato half for color, but they're easy, these greens.</p>  <p>What to drink with salad</p>  <p>Side salad</p>  <p>This salad (sometimes called a ""garden salad"") comes with the purchase of an entree. Lettuce and tomato are inevitable. Cucumber and carrots are a possibility. There may be an errant crouton or two. The dressing is of your choosing (unless you are eating sushi, in which case it's carrot-ginger, which is invariably the best thing about the salad), but you should probably go with ranch.</p>  <p>Layered salads</p>  <p>Now it's a party! Likely not many people are busting out the seven-layer extravaganza for Wednesday supper, but I am not here to judge. I'm just here to scoop through the glorious strata of cheese, eggs, meat, mayonnaise and assorted vegetables until my mind touches the void.</p>  <p>Bean salad</p>  <p>It has beans in it. In a dressing that's usually a vinaigrette. Sometimes onions. There you go.</p>  <p>Featured ingredient salad</p>  <p>An iceberg wedge with some blue cheese dressing and maybe a few bacon crumbles is one of modern culinary society's most perfect achievements. For some people, beets tossed in a little bit of dressing is salad nirvana, but I don't care for beets, so I'll have to trust them. Tomatoes with a little bit of olive oil and balsamic dressing, maybe a few scattered herbs, is a dandy salad, but add mozzarella, and you're dabbling in Caprese territory, and that has rules. Watermelon and feta -- you two crazy kids go get to know each other. You're all each other needs.</p>  <p>I saw a woman on the subway once eating avocado salad from a plastic grocery store tub, and she seemed happier than I have ever been about anything in my entire life.</p>  <p>And I'm throwing potato salad in here because otherwise I'd have to spend another 1,000 words parsing regional and moral variations, and no one needs that. Suffice it to say: mayo, no mayo, pick a lane.</p>  <p>Fruit salad</p>  <p>Here's some cut-up fruit all mixed together. Maybe it has some syrup on it, maybe vinegar, maybe not. Sometimes it has onions or shallots in it, which is just weird. Please enjoy.</p>  <p>Slaw</p>  <p>Honestly, I was on the fence about whether this is a salad or a condiment, but seeing as ""slaw mix"" is sold next to bagged salad in most grocery stores, a case can be made. Salad is a many-splendored thing, and shredded, vinaigrette-dressed vegetables with crunch aplenty seem closer to the nexus of my salad consciousness than meat chunks. I'll allow it.</p>  <p>Gelatin/Congealed salad</p>  <p>These salads are the stuff of comedy to many people, a throwback ""ugh"" at an American population as yet unhipped to the ways of ""organic"" and ""farm-to-buffet"" and whatnot. Those people are missing out, because these homages to the early-to-mid-20th-century salad artisans are not only architecturally interesting when allowed to set in a festive mold but also madly delicious in both sweet and savory forms. To turn one's nose up at a tomato aspic is to pooh-pooh pleasure and a chance to chow down on some living, wiggling history.</p>  <p>Taco salad</p>  <p>Some years ago, Taco Bell ran a tongue-in-cheek ad campaign about how their hard-fried shells filled with beef, beans, cheese and vegetable matter were ""technically"" a salad. OK, I'll buy that, because that's how I'm rolling linguistically these days, but you're not fooling anyone, least of all your health care professional, into thinking this is a healthy decision on your part. (Does a salad need to be healthy? Discuss.)</p>  <p>Mayonnaise salad</p>  <p>Mayonnaise is something of a magical substance . It's simple in composition -- eggs, oil and a hint of vinegar -- but it possesses the power to transform any random foodstuffs into ""salad."" Got cold poultry that needs to be dispatched? BOOM! Chicken salad. Leftover macaroni? Macaroni salad! Some random things from the crisper and a handful of cheese shreds or nuts or whatever? Salad to the rescue! And this is not a condemnation, by the way, but rather a celebration of the American sense of self determination and resourcefulness.</p>  <p>Caveat: If it's a meat, egg or fish salad, it requires at least one lettuce leaf, or it's just sandwich filling.</p>  <p>Includes/not limited to: chicken salad, egg salad, ham salad, Waldorf salad, macaroni salad, various church salads that often include raisins and carrots and nuts and I'm getting very hungry right now.</p>  <p>Sweet salad</p>  <p>A person may also call this a ""fluff"" or ""dessert"" salad, but there is often some kind of creamy binding agent (Cool Whip, cream cheese, sour cream or the like), a high possibility of marshmallows and some manner of fruit. Sometimes, these salads have Snickers bars, red hots or circus peanuts in them. Strawberries, pretzels, cream cheese, Jell-O and sugar? That's a thing.</p>  <p>I grew up in a home where ""Aunt Catherine Salad"" (fruit cocktail, cream cheese, sugar and Cool Whip) was in semi-regular rotation, and look how I turned ... OK, maybe not the greatest example, but ambrosia salad (both with and without whipped cream and marshmallows but definitely including oranges and coconut) fits into this category, which is reason enough for it to exist.</p>  <p>Pasta salad/grain salad</p>  <p>Perhaps people cook pasta, quinoa, rice and other carbs expressly for the sake of producing these salads, but I can't help but feel that leftovers are being foisted. I have no beef with leftovers, but at least be up-front about it. Cold starches like these absolutely require some kind of crunchy textural element (celery is just fine), or else you're just gumming down old fusilli and bulgur, and that's a little depressing.</p>  <p>Meat salad</p>  <p>Cut up meat, no mayo. YOLO.</p>  <p>Have I neglected your favorite salad? Probably. Feel free to scream at me in the comments.</p> "
"259","A new era of food halls","CNN.com","2014-08-21 18:17:42","2014-10-06 06:08:14","http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/living/new-food-halls-eatocracy/index.html","Living"," <p>He chose a small restaurant on Atlanta's Buford Highway, a long stretch of cookie-cutter shopping centers known for its variety of ethnic food. He expected to attract customers from Asian communities in nearby Gwinnett County. He did not anticipate that non-Asian food lovers from Atlanta's urban core would make up nearly half the clientele.</p>  <p>When an opportunity arose to get closer to his emerging customer base, and share space with some of Atlanta's food superstars, he jumped at it. Gu's Bistro is not going anywhere at the moment, but his next concept is about as far as you can get from Buford Highway.</p>  <p>Gu's Dumplings will open this fall at Atlanta's Krog Street Market , a 9,000-square-foot, mixed-use space that's been the talk of the Atlanta food scene for more than a year. Anchored by sit-down restaurants from local big-name chefs, the reclaimed warehouse will house 27 retail spaces and market stalls offering prepared food and specialty products.</p>  <p>The market's developers envision a ""food hall"" where diners can roam from stall to stall, choosing from baked goods, barbecue, deli sandwiches, or Gu's dumplings. Or, they can grab a table at one of three sit-down restaurants, or pick up fresh seafood, cured meats and cheese and a growler of craft beer to bring home.</p>  <p>Food halls are the latest culinary trend spreading inward from the coasts, born of an era in which the old way of buying and consuming is new again. It's a throwback to one-roof shopping from different vendors who had a hand in in the product's creation, with a modern emphasis on the locally-sourced and artisanally-crafted. They give emerging talent a shot at brick-and-mortar locations, often with fewer start-up costs, and allow established chefs a chance to experiment. Across the country, they offer a snapshot of a community's culinary identity.</p>  <p>Krog Street's roster features both kinds of businesses, allowing visitors to experience food they might not encounter otherwise because of accessibility or cost.</p>  <p>CNN host Anthony Bourdain, who is planning to open his own food hall in New York, told Departures magazine, ""I think there's a real appetite for more low-impact, more casual, yet good-quality meal options.</p>  <p>""That goes along with a shift in dining habits in general. On one hand, we demand more variety, better quality, more options. On the other, we seem fatigued with the conventions and time investment of a multi-course, full-service meal.""</p>  <p>The focus on handmade products and local talent has led to criticism in other cities that food halls are destinations for the wealthy, that they serve tourists rather than those who live in the community. But Krog Street's developers say they chose their location in Atlanta's intown neighborhood of Inman Park with the community in mind, taking into account things like demographics and average household income and proximity to the Beltline, a multi-use trail and green space that represents Atlanta's biggest ongoing infrastructure project.</p>  <p>""The growth in Atlanta is happening in intown neighborhoods. That's where there are more people with disposable income who are willing to spend it on eating out,"" said Merritt Lancaster a partner with developer Paces Properties. ""Some of the offerings might be pricier than what you'd find at the grocery store but we believe that you get what you pay for. That's what we set out to do -- find chefs that are producing the highest quality food available.""</p>  <p>The growing popularity of the local movement in Atlanta also made the timing right, Lancaster's colleague George Banks said.</p>  <p>""Even five years ago I don't think the numbers were there for Atlanta to support this. I don't think the local food movement here had hit critical mass,"" he said. ""I think we're there now.""</p>  <p>Rooted in history</p>  <p>Destinations such as Philadelphia's Reading Terminal Market, Seattle's Pike Place Market and Los Angeles' Grand Central Market have withstood the test of time, maintaining a connection to the era before supermarkets, convenience stores and fast-food drive-thrus while extending their hours and expanding their offerings for a generation on the go.</p>  <p>Prepared food and restaurants have been a part of the Los Angeles' Grand Central Market since the early days. A market brochure from 1922 lists bakeries, delis, a coffee stall, butchers, cheesemongers, fishmongers, an oyster vendor, and greengrocers -- categories that still exist at the market, spokesman Jim Yeager said. The same 1922 brochure also lists seven restaurants, including a Chinese restaurant in the basement, The Cherry Blossom, serving ""Chop Suey, Chow Mein, and Noodles.""</p>  <p>The market changed owners over the years, expanding in the 1980s to include a movie theater. It extended its hours in July to stay open until 9 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, and marquee vendors such as Belcampo Meat Co. and Olio GCM Wood Fired Pizzeria added beer and wine lists.</p>  <p>New vendors have come in over the years, ""many of them of the new artisan sort that has become so common in Portland, Brooklyn, and Silverlake recently,"" L.A. Times food writer Jonathan Gold said. It's a reflection of the neighborhood's increasingly wealthy demographic.</p>  <p>""The urban mix, the smells, and the light seem uniquely of Los Angeles, especially the way the welter of Mexican and Salvadoran places intersect with the kombucha and the macadamia milk lattes, although perhaps the diversity of local Asian cooking is underrepresented,"" Gold said in an e-mail.</p>  <p>It's not as glamorous as San Francisco's Ferry Market or a tourist destination in the same way as Seattle's Pike Place, he said. But new vendors such as Wexler's Deli (which Gold recently reviewed positively ), Belcampo, G&B and McConnell's are among the best in the city, and ""the lines on Sunday mornings are stunning,"" he said.</p>  <p>""It has become talked about in a way it hasn't in many years.""</p>  <p>Krog Street Market aims to create a similar experience from Day One, building on the success of modern forebears such as San Francisco's Ferry Building Marketplace and New York's Chelsea Market. Both offer an updated experience of the old-school food market by keeping longer hours and offering high-end restaurant-quality food in casual settings, along with the opportunity to buy fresh fare.</p>  <p>An occasional sour note</p>  <p>Finding spaces for those modern food meccas drove developers to the outskirts of major urban areas, which can be hard to reach. Locals also have to battle crowds of tourists, leading San Francisco's Ferry Building Marketplace to offer a ""veggie valet"" where people can leave their goods while they shop. Many residents of Chelsea avoid their neighborhood market on weekends.</p>  <p>""There are some fantastic vendors in the Marketplace, and there is no denying the Saturday CUESA Ferry Plaza farmers market is like our high culinary church, full of dedicated local shoppers each week. But the primary gripe is the challenging and noncentralized location,"" said Marcia Gagliardi, founder and editor of San Francisco's Tablehopper website.</p>  <p>It's in a part of town that isn't easy accessible and gets backed up with traffic, she said, ""and, of course, jockeying for vegetables in the Ferry Plaza farmers' market while tourists cluelessly poke around and graze on fruit samples can be frustrating,"" she said.</p>  <p>Sweet rewards for locals</p>  <p>For many, though, it's worth the effort. Before the Ferry Marketplace opened in 2003, grocery shopping entailed trips to neighborhood farmers' markets and several local shops, she said. At the Ferry Market, shoppers can still meet the people who made their food, but they can do it in one place.</p>  <p>""The Ferry Building Marketplace is such a uniquely San Franciscan market because of the local vendors. It's a great way to experience so many of our local artisans in one spot, to get that 'taste of Northern California bounty,'"" Gagliardi said.</p>  <p>People come with a checklist, she said: Secret Breakfast from Humphry Slocombe, Blue Bottle New Orleans iced coffee, sourdough bread, ""All while looking at the water and the Bay Bridge.""</p>  <p>""It's that local-sustainable-organic thing we do here, which we're seeing more and more around the country. A return to the artisanal.""</p>  <p>Other new food halls and markets have arisen from the desire for an alternative to historic markets come up in response to the desire for more handcrafted and regional offerings closer to home. Seattle's Pike Place Market gets all the attention for its produce vendors, food stands and fish flingers. But Melrose Market in the Capitol Hill neighborhood is a favorite spot for locals to eat, drink and shop, said food writer Megan Hill .</p>  <p>""Pike Place Market is a great place to go to really feel the pulse of Seattle's history and its modern personality meeting head on,"" Hill said. ""It's primarily a tourist spot, as the 10 million or so visitors a year can attest to. But most tourists simply go to see the fish guys throw a mackerel and sample a bit of the local produce on the first level and then they leave. Locals know that Pike Place is a gem of hidden spots and great restaurants that all source very locally.</p>  <p>""Melrose Market is smack in the middle of a neighborhood, so most of the patrons are locals going to buy a gift, meet friends for happy hour, visit a butcher shop or eat a great meal. That's not to say locals don't also go to do these things at Pike Place -- and I certainly encourage them to do those things -- but the feel is much different,"" Hill explained.</p>  <p>Krog Street's first restaurant, The Luminary , helmed by ""Top Chef"" alum Eli Kirshtein opened last week, much to the delight of local food fanatics who have been salivating over news of each development since the project broke ground in early 2013. Next up: a ""Mex-Tex"" restaurant from Atlanta stalwart Ford Fry and a Kickstarter-funded restaurant and butcher from local charcuterie Spotted Trotter. Rising star Todd Ginsberg has been testing out cheesesteaks at his restaurant, General Muir, and other dishes for his sandwich shop, which will share space with his Israeli restaurant, Yalla.</p>  <p>The opportunity to share space with some of the hottest names in Atlanta's food scene without directly competing with them is part of what attracted Gu to the site. Consisting mainly of dumplings, noodles and veggie dishes, Gu's stall will offer a scaled-down version of the 100-item menu at his Buford Highway restaurant.</p>  <p>""We liked the concept because almost every tenant has some kind of reputation,"" Yvonne Gu said. ""The concept is one Chinese, one coffee, one barbecue -- only one of each, but one of the best of each.""</p> "

For each restaurant in the top 100 , I asked myself first and foremost 'Is the food delicious?' I then considered the restaurant's relevance in the modern food landscape. I took into account a chef's technical skill and his or her creativity with ingredients. Geography obviously played a role; I included restaurants within the Southern Living coverage area (17 states plus DC). And I factored in the overall experience,"" Cole explained.</p>  <p>Southern Living: Secret Recipes from the South's Best Dives</p>  <p>For the 10 best new restaurants, Cole says the restaurant had to have opened between July 2013 and June 2014 to be considered. She visited each anonymously and Southern Living paid for all of her meals.</p>  <p>""I traveled nearly 24,000 miles while researching this list,"" said Cole. ""Of course, I applied the same stringent criteria as with the overall list. In addition, I considered what each new restaurant contributes to the patchwork quilt of Southern food.

How does it apply the flavors of the modern South?""</p>  <p>Southern Living: 88 Top-Rated Dessert Recipes</p>  <p>And Cole found some trends emerging throughout her travels, notably a relaxing from the white tablecloth, tasting menu, suit-wearing waiters that had been a hallmark of some Southern dining until recently.</p>  <p>So what did she find? ""More open kitchens, exposed wood, and waitstaff in jeans and button-downs. That's not to say service is diminished or we're relegated to burgers. I just think we're in a period that's less about fine dining and one that's more about casual grace or fine casual.""</p>  <p>And now that you know how the list-making sausage got made, let's get to the main course.</p>  <p>Southern Living: What's Your Southern City?</p>  <p>10. The Shack - - Staunton, Virginia</p>  <p>What To Order: Crispy Lamb Shank with English peas, a soft-cooked egg, and hot sauce vinaigrette.</p>  <p>At Ian Boden's shotgun-style restaurant in tiny Staunton, Virginia, he serves up designer dishes from, quite frankly, the sticks. With the lamb shank, Ian layers fresh (sweet green peas), rich (a crisp puck of meaty goodness), and creamy (a perfectly cooked runny egg) to produce a model of simple decadence. Most days, the hand-written menu reads like a bipolar expression of flavors: cold ramen with razor clams and a pickled egg listed above chili cheese fries. Burgers alongside Sardinian Gnocchi with pulled rabbit, morels, ramps, and mustard. But on Friday and Saturday nights, Ian switches to a three-course prix fixe menu that highlights not only the seasonal bounty of rural Virginia but also his impressive talents behind the stove.</p>  <p>105 South Coalter Street; facebook.com/theshacksva</p>  <p>9. Cinco Y Diez - - Athens, Georgia</p>  <p>What To Order: Grilled Chesapeake Oysters with mezcal lime butter, and the Red Chile Pozole.</p>  <p>Influences from France to western Africa have long informed how Southerners eat. Today, it's Vietnam and Latin America that are most shaping the modern South. At Cinco y Diez, chef/owner Hugh Acheson, an outspoken proponent of the all-inclusive table, highlights the vibrant Latin traditions through a soft-focus Southern lens. And executive chef Whitney Otawka transforms the Southern pantry into a fiery amalgamation of cross-cultural flavors. Oysters from Chesapeake waters sizzle with tangy mezcal lime butter. In the pozole, chunks of silken pork bathe in a red chile broth with Anson Mills hominy, escarole, and fresh radish slices.</p>  <p>1653 South Lumpkin Street; cincoydiezathens.com</p>  <p>Southern Living: The South's Best Barbeque</p>  <p>8. San Salvaje - - Dallas, Texas</p>  <p>What To Order: Fried Whole Snapper with pickled green beans and mango-habanero mojo.</p>  <p>At chef Stephan Pyles' modern take on haute Latin, expect creative riffs on traditional dishes. You'll find ceviches, tacos, empanadas, and the like, but with modern interpretations. With the Fried Whole Snapper, the fish is split and stuffed with a spiky fistful of tempura-battered pickled green beans and placed atop a chunky mango-habanero mojo. The Ahi Tuna Ceviche, served in a halved coconut shell, arrives scented with kaffir and studded with sweet coconut. The Chocolate Tamal, a mole-rich expression of a tamale, is stuffed with wild boar and topped with cherry salsita. San Salvaje showcases chef Pyles' current obsession with Central and South American flavors, with perfect measures of ingenuity and restraint.</p>  <p>#100, 2100 Ross Avenue; sansalvaje.com</p>  <p>7. Edmund's Oast - - Charleston, SC</p>  <p>What To Order: Carolina Gold Rice Heritage Chicken Porridge.</p>  <p>I like to think of Edmund's Oast as a stylish gastropub with righteous charcuterie. But that almost undersells it. The craft beer program is unparalleled in South Carolina, with some 40-odd beers on tap, including a handful made in-house, and over 30 bottled options. The cocktail program is relentlessly ambitious. And dishes like the buttermilk fried wings, the pickled shrimp on rye bread, and the roasted-and-smoked chicken with cornbread pudding demonstrate the kitchen's finesse with classic grub. But it's the outliers—creamy spiced turnip custard, lemony chicken porridge with poached shrimp, braised lamb meatballs with apricots—that make me want to return.</p>  <p>1081 Morrison Drive; edmundsoast.com</p>  <p>6. CBD Provisions -- Dallas, TX</p>  <p>What To Order: Berkshire Pig Head Carnitas.</p>  <p>At this meat-centric, Texas-style brasserie, you can't go wrong with the roasted pig head. It arrives at the table—snout, ears, and all—crisp and fatty atop a wooden plank. For anyone who loves a proper pig pickin', this is your tableside porcine dream. Wrap the rich and smoky meat in fresh tortillas, pile on crunchy bits of skin, and top with radishes and roasted tomatillo salsa. Plan to come with friends—this dish is meant to be shared.</p>  <p>1530 Main Street; cbdprovisions.com</p>  <p>Southern Living: 75 Most Stylish Southerners</p>  <p>5. Rhubarb -- Asheville, NC</p>  <p>What To Order: Brick Oven Prince Edward Island Mussels in a Celery-Fennel Broth with Benton's Bacon and Grilled Chapata Bread.</p>  <p>John Fleer, the chef who shone a light on Appalachian foodways at Blackberry Farm, emerged last fall with Rhubarb in Asheville. Touchstones of his legacy (Benton's bacon, Sunburst trout) are there. But Rhubarb is no history lesson. He digs deep into the region's traditions, adds global influence, and highlights the local larder. Benton's bacon shows up in a bowl of mussels in a silken celery-fennel broth. The roasted whole trout bathes in wood smoke before joining a crisp potato-celeriac latke. At Blackberry, John put Southern foodstuffs on the map. At Rhubarb, he's showing just how far he can stretch them.</p>  <p>7 SW. Pack Square; rhubarbasheville.com</p>  <p>4. The Obstinate Daughter -- Sullivan's Island, SC</p>  <p>What To Order: Favas and Peas or Mepkin Abbey Mushrooms</p>  <p>Though the wood-fired pizzas and pastas conjure Italy, Jacques Larson relies mightily on the flavors of the Lowcountry. Under the Plates section, Jacques' command of flavor as sense of place shines. Oyster mushrooms from the nearby Mepkin Abbey join earthy kale and a runny Sea Island egg under shards of Parmesan. Favas and peas sit atop ricotta made with milk from John's Island, accented with sea salt from nearby Bulls Bay.</p>  <p>2063 Middle Street; theobstinatedaughter.com</p>  <p>3. The 404 Kitchen -- Nashville, TN</p>  <p>What to Order: The Crudo</p>  <p>Chef Matt Bolus calls his brand of cooking fresh and uncomplicated, but there's some cloaked modesty there. Everything about this industrial-chic 40-seater blends functionality, novelty, and a little ""I'm with the band, but I'm not the rock star"" attitude. In the Crudo, simple slices of cobia are dotted with pickled strawberries, pea tendrils, and Marcona almonds. For his Tomato Galette, Matt envelops lemony ricotta in a toasted cornmeal crust, and piles on heirloom tomatoes—a twist on tomato pie without any pretension. Much like Nashville these days, it's all familiar—but new.</p>  <p>404 12th Avenue South; the404nashville.com/kitchen</p>  <p>2. Rose's Luxury - - Washington, D.C.</p>  <p>What To Order: Uni Scrambled Eggs.</p>  <p>For chef/owner Aaron Silverman, luxury isn't about fine china and Champagne poured in unison. ""It's how you feel, how people treat you,"" he says. And as a result there's a homey—never folksy—sophistication that resonates throughout the restaurant. The custardy bowl of scrambled eggs makes a decadent leap with briny, rich layers of uni (sea urchin): pureed, sliced, and whisked into hollandaise. As with anything, it all boils down to the execution. And so far, Rose's is doing luxury right.</p>  <p>717 Eighth Street SE.; rosesluxury.com</p>  <p>1. Kimball House -- Decatur, GA</p>  <p>What To Order: Oysters and absinthe-based cocktails.</p>  <p>I've yet to see another spot in the South with such a thoughtful—and joyful—oyster program. The menu lists, give or take, 22 oyster varieties, most sourced from small family farms and flown in daily, with the kinds of tasting notes more frequently reserved for wine lists. The Chelsea Gems from Eld Inlet, Washington, are likened to ""anise and buttered truffle""; the Northern Cross from Fisherman's Island, Virginia, ""salted parsnip and green onion."" And local bar hero Miles Macquarrie wields his magic wand with drinks like the Afternoon Delight, a heady yet refreshing mix of absinthe, lime, pineapple, tarragon, and bubbles.</p>  <p>303 East Howard Avenue; kimball-house.com</p>  <p>See the other 90 restaurants at Southern Living</p>  <p>What restaurants would have made your list?

Lester Ferris really wants to be is ""Dad.""</p>  <p>""Tigerman"" is about geopolitics, environmental disaster and the 24-hour news culture. But, at its core, Harkaways says ""Tigerman"" is a story about fatherhood and the ""power of paternal and filial love.""</p>  <p>It's not your typical father-son story, says Harkaway, a married father of two and the son of legendary spy novelist John le Carré. But, ""something about the nature of guns and the similarities between being an NCO (noncommissioned officer) and a parent,"" combined with revelations in the British press in 2010 about rendition, led Harkaway to start writing.</p>  <p>The book deals with darker themes of justice and vengeance, similar to another hero with father issues, ""Batman."" Despite the comic book overtones and its location on a fictional island scheduled by NATO for demolition, Harkaway says he tried to keep the story grounded in reality.</p>  <p>In other words, no laws of physics are broken, he says. ""It's the most real, in a way, of the books I've written.""</p>  <p>After years of dodging enemy fire in Afghanistan and Iraq, the main character Ferris is sent to the fictional island of Mancreu, a ""spit of land"" in the Arabian Sea, to serve as the last representative of Her Majesty's government.</p>  <p>On Mancreu, Ferris meets a nameless, streetwise boy raised on comic books, action movies and video games. His self-taught English is a mish-mash of ""leetspeak"" -- the language of the elite -- riddled with pop-culture references and Internet slang.</p>  <p>Most importantly, the boy may be an orphan. Ferris is also a man without a family. When he and the boy bond over their mutual love of comic books and afternoon tea, Ferris starts to imagine life as a father. Ferris' hopes bloom into a plan to adopt the boy (if he's willing) and forge a future together.</p>  <p>But the sergeant and the boy face a deadline for their would-be family. After years of ecological abuse, Mancreu has become an environmental disaster. NATO has earmarked the island for destruction. Residents who can afford it are ""Leaving"" with a capital ""L."" Others are hanging on and facing eventual evacuation.</p>  <p>With an end date looming, anarchy and lawlessness spread across the island, think Casablanca, only with ""discharge clouds"" of toxic pollution.</p>  <p>When a group of gun-toting thugs kills a mutual friend, the boy inspires Ferris to become ""Tigerman,"" part vigilante, part myth and ""full of win,"" as the boy says.</p>  <p>The sergeant dons a homemade mask, body armor and utility belt to battle bad guys and hopefully convince the boy to become his son when the dust settles.</p>  <p>Comic book fans will recognize elements of the Caped Crusader, with Ferris playfully referring to the boy as ""Robin"" in the book.</p>  <p>Harkaway names ""Dark Knight"" and ""Sandman"" among his childhood favorites. But ""Tigerman"" isn't so much his version of ""Batman"" as it is his take ""on me, or any of us, shoved into being a costumed hero,"" he says.</p>  <p>""Batman is one of a small number of characters who get the title 'superhero' despite having no actual superpowers. Although I've heard it said that he has the best superpower of all, that of being ridiculously rich in a world where technology can make you a god.""</p>  <p>Harkaway is the author of two previous genre-bending and critically-acclaimed novels, ""The Gone-Away World"" and ""Angelmaker."" Despite his famous lineage, he says he doesn't pattern his work after his famous father.</p>  <p>""We haven't spent a lot of time consciously talking about writing in a master-student kind of way, but we have similar concerns, ethical worries, (and) geopolitical perceptions in some areas.

The contents are under pressure from gas created by fermentation and can rise out of the jar after it's open. -- Many kimchi enthusiasts opt to keep a second refrigerator in the garage for kimchi storage, so the funky smells are kept away from the other food and living areas. -- Kimchi sold in stores may be as fresh as a week-and-a-half old, but the flavors will continue to develop in the jar. Chung says the flavors of kimchi deepen even more after six months or so. -- Kimchi most often accompanies Korean food, but also goes well with burgers, tacos, hot dogs or even on eggs for breakfast.</p> "

They have been trained to support children who deviate from gender norms, whether it's a boy in girls' clothes or a child who was born a girl and wants to be called a boy. And, they know it's school policy.</p>  <p>""Diversity is a good thing. We all benefit from the unique characteristics that we all have,"" Pollock said. ""Our goal is to build a culture of inclusivity and understanding and a mindset of being welcoming to everyone.""</p>  <p>Across the country, schools are adopting similar mantras for transgender and gender nonconforming children in their mission statements and policies. Advocates say the efforts reflect growing support for research showing the negative effects of enforcing fixed ideas of what it means to be a boy or a girl on children, especially in learning environments.</p>  <p>""This is the reality in which we live: Gender is a continuum, not a box,"" said Graciela Slesaransky-Poe , dean of Arcadia University's School of Education in Pennsylvania. Her experience with a gender-nonconforming child led her to become a consultant who has helped schools across the country learn to accommodate children who are opening up about gender identity as early as kindergarten.</p>  <p>""We need to be sure we don't create structures and artifices to reinforce binaries that limit and constrain the ways in which we behave and express ourselves.""</p>  <p>The right to an education free of discrimination based on gender identity is protected by federal, state, and local laws. The US Department of Education in April reaffirmed a 2010 declaration that ""Title IX's sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity."" Massachusetts and California are among the growing number of states with strong legal protections for transgender and gender nonconforming students. At least 160 cities and have passed laws prohibiting gender identity discrimination, according to advocacy group Gender Spectrum . Wisconsin's Madison Metropolitan School District is one of many districts to issue guidance to administrators for creating a welcoming environment for transgender and gender nonconforming students.</p>  <p>The efforts are not always welcomed by the community. Opponents of California AB 1266 are working to get it on the ballot for veto referendum . This week, a Nebraska parent raised objections over training for Lincoln Public School staff about lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender issues.</p>  <p>In an email to parents, the mother cited handouts, including one called ""12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness"" that recommended against ""gendered"" expressions such as ""boys and girls,"" the Lincoln Journal Star reported . The mother and school district did not respond to CNN's request for comment.</p>  <p>""By sidelining academic teacher training and replacing it with social re-engineering, the LPS administration has placed a higher priority on social reformation than on education,"" the mother said in an ""introductory speech"" prepared for an upcoming school board meeting, according to documents obtained by the Journal Star .</p>  <p>Advocates say improving school climate and legal protections are important because transgender and gender nonconforming children are frequent targets of bullying. A 2012 survey found that 42% of gender nonconforming students feel safe at school, compared to 62% of their gender conforming counterparts. More than 40% of students who participated in a 2005 National School Climate Survey felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression; 26% said they were physically harassed the previous year because of their gender expression.</p>  <p>""The work that we do is not to make schools safer just for transgender students, but to make schools safe for everyone regardless of where they fall on the gender spectrum,"" said Kim Westheimer, director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Family Project's Welcoming Schools initiative. The program helps schools, such as Garden Oaks Montessori, create an inclusive climate through staff training, policy recommendations, and bullying prevention approaches.</p>  <p>Creating a welcoming environment is an ongoing process that involves various stakeholders from the school community. Here are some steps that educators, parents and advocacy groups recommend for creating a gender inclusive school community.</p>  <p>1. Don't separate children by gender</p>  <p>When it's time to work in groups, experts recommend coming up with alternatives for separating children. The first letters of their last names, birthday months, clothing colors or types of pets they own are just some ways to do it, but many more exist.</p>  <p>Separating by categories other than gender helps children identify and build relationships based on common ground -- or, at the very least, start conversations. In other words, it helps them learn to relate to others based on similarities (and differences) other than gender.</p>  <p>2. Start the day with inclusive language and stick with it</p>  <p>Instead of saying ""good morning, boys and girls,"" experts recommend using broader language to convey a sense of equality and togetherness. Again, a variety of alternatives exist, such ""good morning, class"" or ""good morning, everyone.""</p>  <p>Using inclusive language throughout the day reinforces the idea that boys and girls are not limited by their biology to succeed in the same arenas, said Rhonda Thomason with Welcoming Schools. Often, we imply that boys or girls are only good at specific things through the subtle (and not-so-subtle) things we say, or the activities we nudge them toward.</p>  <p>3. Feature diversity in books, posters and other workbooks</p>  <p>Welcoming Schools , Gender Spectrum and TransYouth Family Allies offer bibliographies and other resources for classroom materials featuring diversity in various forms.</p>  <p>A wide selection of children's books feature transgender and gender expansive children. Many more feature men and women in nonstereotypical roles of all races and sexual orientation; the same goes for posters that hang in classrooms.</p>  <p>4. Create a professional development plan to help educators</p>  <p>Some schools devote several administrative prep days to familiarizing staff with issues surrounding transgender and gender variant children. After all, teachers set classroom tone through language and lesson plans. They also can intervene in instances of bullying or name-calling and, when appropriate, use them as teachable moments.</p>  <p>In order to act, experts say educators need to develop a shared understanding of gender identity and language to be able to communicate with students and parents. But they need to know what to look for, and they need to believe that they have the support of the school, which leads to the next suggestion.</p>  <p>5. Have strong policies to support transgender students</p>  <p>Some schools may not know what do if a child who was referred to by male pronouns now uses female pronouns. What does that mean in the classroom, or on their transcript?</p>  <p>Policies should address how to handle names and pronouns, bathroom use, extracurricular activities, student records, and confidentiality, said Westheimer with Welcoming Schools. These issues can be complicated, so best to consult an expert in your area or national organizations such as Welcoming Schools , Gender Spectrum or TransYouth Family Allies .</p>  <p>6. Engage the entire school community</p>  <p>Each school approaches this differently. One school in Maine sent a letter home to parents informing them that a second-grader who identified as a girl the previous year would be recognized as a boy this year. Others incorporate the discussion into class or school-wide meetings.</p>  <p>The goal is the same: to set community norms for what's expected and create a platform for people to ask questions.</p> "

She said that Utah ""was drowning in prescription pill addiction."" Shannon divulged that she had actually been abusing heroin for some time, but -- as with most people with addiction problems in Utah -- it all started with pills.</p>  <p>Out of all 50 states, Utah ranks eighth in the number of prescription drugs overdose deaths, according to Susannah Burt with the state's Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health . And, despite a dip in 2008, the number of pill-related deaths in Utah over the past decade has increased by 400%, according to Burt.</p>  <p>I have always thought Utah had low levels of addiction because of the influence of its large Mormon population -- more than 60% of those living there are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I've even known Mormons there who don't drink coffee in deference to their religion's ""Word of Wisdom,"" a health law that strongly discourages people from consuming things that are harmful to their bodies.</p>  <p>You'd have to be hiding under a rock to not know how highly addictive prescription pills can be . And people in Utah, who have statistically speaking been successful at maintaining healthier lives , are no less vulnerable. In fact, because medications are prescribed by a physician, the assumption often is that they're OK.</p>  <p>Many people who've been able to maintain diligence in upholding the LDS Word of Wisdom have fallen victim to pill addiction because of the gray area that doctor-prescribed pills inhabit.</p>  <p>While the Mormon church hierarchy certainly isn't proud of the exploding numbers, it didn't hide from the issue, giving us access to talk to those dealing with the struggles of addiction.</p>  <p>Earlier this year, we spent 12 days in Utah with church leaders and people in recovery as well as people deep in the throes of addiction. I met people who wore their hearts on their sleeves who shared some of their most painful moments.</p>  <p>They allowed me into their worlds because they acknowledge pill addiction is a huge problem within their community and they know they need help.</p>  <p>The people I spent time with are incredibly brave -- particularly Shannon who I'm happy to report has been clean for quite awhile now.

But my drug of choice is one that will likely elicit more eye rolls and accusations than loving embraces of support.</p>  <p>Food is my drug.</p>  <p>According to the informal definition, an ""addict"" is ""an enthusiastic devotee of a specified thing or activity."" That's me, all day. You couldn't find anyone more enthusiastic about food and eating than yours truly.</p>  <p>My Instagram account is evidence of that. The food photos there compete only with the number of strategically shot selfies (all positioned in such a way to conceal my fat of course).</p>  <p>In my spare time I devour food autobiographies that I attack as lustfully as a porn junkie -- often pairing them with something delicious.</p>  <p>I have driven a stupid amount of miles to satisfy a craving and even canceled on friends to sit in my house and eat. More of my money has been spent dining in good restaurants and buying groceries than some people make in a year. I've eaten to the point of getting sick and once I was empty, have eaten again.</p>  <p>The number of diets I've started and stopped is not even worth mentioning here because in the end I always go fleeing back to my first love: food.</p>  <p>I hate to exercise, but have managed to use my treadmill and hit the gym more than a few times. But it makes me so hungry I feel like I undo all of that work the minute I can get to food.</p>  <p>First Person: My life as a little person</p>  <p>Before I met my husband I once joked to a friend that food was my boyfriend. The only ""man"" who could truly satisfy me.</p>  <p>""What's the difference if I say I'll go away when I know I'll come back on my knees someday? For whatever my man is I'm his, forever more,"" I told her, quoting song lyrics when she suggested we join a workplace weight loss campaign.</p>  <p>These days, food is more like my closest friend than a lover, but its influence is just as strong. It's a weird place to find myself in given that as a child, my parents had to force me to eat.</p>  <p>I was a short, skinny kid who at the age of 4 was so petite that I was mistaken for a toddler. I suffered major problems with my adenoids, tonsils and sinuses and consequently food tasted like snot to me.</p>  <p>At age 9, I had my tonsils and adenoids removed. That changed everything.</p>  <p>I was just home from the hospital and my parents grabbed cheese-steak subs for themselves for dinner.</p>  <p>Upstairs in my bedroom, sipping soup and still nursing the post-tonsilectomy sore throat, I suddenly smelled the most delicious aroma. You know how in cartoons a smell wafts and tickles the character under the nose? That was how those subs smelled to me and I floated downstairs to investigate. As I stood, practically drooling, my mother asked, ""Would you like a taste?""</p>  <p>I went on to gain about 30 pounds in the months following my surgery and that hasn't slowed.</p>  <p>It's not as if I haven't successfully shed weight before, but the moment I start, I figure out some way to undermine it. My mind attacks me with thoughts that hurt to even type:</p>  <p>Would my more attractive girlfriends like me as much if I were ""on their level?""</p>  <p>Would the increased attention from men cause my marriage to crumble?</p>  <p>Why should I have to live in a constant state of denying myself when others can eat what they want and be slim?</p>  <p>And worst of all: What if absolutely nothing changes at all other than my body? What will I then blame life's disappointments on?</p>  <p>I know that so much of my food and weight issues are really about my emotions. That was driven home recently when a counselor suggested ""When Food is Love"" by Geneen Roth.</p>  <p>I was in my kitchen, waiting for dinner to be ready when I read this passage and broke down sobbing: ""Compulsive behavior, at its most fundamental, is a lack of self-love; it is an expression of a belief that we are not good enough.""</p>  <p>At that moment I realized that I have been trying to fill my heart by filling my stomach. But pinpointing the pain means going places I fear.</p>  <p>Living with anxiety, hoping for joy</p>  <p>I'm more afraid of delving into what is killing me (and trust me I am so aware that it is killing me) than I am of dying. Every extra pound represents a pain for me, something I don't like to acknowledge, not even to myself. I grew up in a family where we didn't talk about our struggles -- we ate or drank them away. I have continued that legacy.</p>  <p>After a love affair that didn't work out, I took to my bed with a box of Ritz crackers and two cans of squeeze cheese. I jokingly told my roommate that I was ""sitting shiva"" for the relationship that I was convinced would take me off the market. The one that would stop the cycle of men who spoke to me in code.</p>  <p>""You aren't my usual type."" (""I usually avoid fat girls, but you are cool."")</p>  <p>""You are so easy to talk to!"" (""When my friends question how I can be with you I can always point to your personality."")</p>  <p>Thirteen years ago, I married a man who has always told me how beautiful he thinks I am. But it has done little to assuage the fact that for all of my outgoingness and sunny manner, I do not love myself enough.</p>  <p>I hate not being able to fit my purse in the seat beside me or having to ask for an extender on an airplane because the seat belt may not fit. I hate the smirky looks sales people give me in regular clothing stores -- the look that says, ""Surely you aren't thinking you will find anything here?""</p>  <p>I hate that I crave the numbing power that food represents to me. The moment I begin to feel happy or sad, I turn to food. Sometimes it's in celebration and sometimes it's to achieve a level of bliss that means I don't have to hurt or process what I am feeling.</p>  <p>Tough day at work? Dinner with co-workers. Fight with a family member? High fat snacks. Who needs tears when there are donuts to be had?</p>  <p>It's a neverending cycle; being fat makes me feel uncomfortable and feeling uncomfortable drives me to the behaviors that make me fat.</p>  <p>What they never tell you about losing a lot of weight</p>  <p>A good friend once told me that I should view the parts of me that need to heal as a younger version of me who I needed to protect. I should talk to ""Little Lisa,"" she said, and tell her how worthy she is of health, self-love and an abundant life.</p>  <p>Only by peeling back the layers of pain, she said, could I get to the real emptiness that I needed to feed -- that part of me that doesn't believe I deserve the blessed life I have with a career, family and friends that I adore.</p>  <p>So, ""Little Lisa,"" this is the first step towards you and I getting to where we need to be. It won't be easy and it's going to hurt. But we are going to do the work and try to be an inspiration to others who have started and failed over and over.</p>  <p>We are going to do it for every overweight person who struggles and those who are no longer here to struggle because their bodies gave out on them.</p>  <p>Most days we are going to want to quit, but we can't because the stakes are too high and there is so much more waiting for us than we have allowed for ourselves.</p>  <p>I've met you. You're worth it.</p> "

(If you're not and you're making some anyway, I salute your life and the way you live it.) Punch should be a lavishly flowing thing, spilling out past the bounds of a mere cocktail shaker. Pitcher? Pah! You're thinking too small. Commandeer your largest cooking pot -- or a punch bowl if you're blessed enough to possess such a thing. Ladle from it with love.</p>  <p>Food52: Rum Punch</p>  <p>But most righteous are those who bypass traditional kitchenware completely and opt for the trash can. In goes the Everclear (dude, there's gotta be Everclear), the contents of the lowest shelf at the liquor store (rum's good, so is vodka, and that weird, off-brand non-Kentucky whiskey that comes in a plastic handle and smells of dorm carpet) and fruit. Gotta be some fruit -- both juiced and whole. No one is getting scurvy, rickets or any other dread pirate diseases on your watch, Captain. Cheers.</p>  <p>Food52: Bumble Brown Punch</p>  <p>Think you're too fancy or grown-up for punch? You deserve no punch. Your Red Solo cup or vintage, cut-crystal glass will be confiscated, and you are hereby sentenced to flat beer and warm vodka tonics until you realize the error of your ways. Punch is an invitation to share in an event, jump into the current, bob to the surface and float merrily with the rest of the crowd. If someone hands you a cup of punch when you walk into their home, backyard or random parking lot, the tone is set and you may as well sing along. (And if you don't drink booze, man, that's cool, too. Totally cool. Stick an umbrella or some hunks of fruit in there for extra festiveness and party the heck on.)</p>  <p>Tips for great party punch</p>  <p>Punch makes a host's life simple, and allows him or her to come across quite hospitably. Mix up a massive batch ahead of time (most are even better when they have a chance to meld for a while), set up a filling station and you're good to go, libation-wise. It's easy enough to scoop out a serving and meet guests at the front door (or over by that guy's station wagon) with a welcome beverage, or allow them to meet over by the punch bowl (or can). Moreover, it leaves a host free to slip through the crowd, mixing, chatting, collecting empties and generally making a splash at this well-lubricated affair.</p>  <p>Food52: Gingered Lemon Punch</p>  <p>And yes, yes -- punch can go pinky-up, topped with champagne and full of mixologically clever macerations. It sure can, and it's fantastic when that happens, but it has to deliver on the implicit promise of punch. There should rightly be a small phalanx of empty spirits bottles to be hauled away after deployment -- not to mention the husks of spent fruit, juiced of all their usefulness or booze-soaked and suited for snacking on in the wee (wheeee!) small hours.</p>  <p>Food52: Apple Rye Punch</p>  <p>Things may be a little sticky the next day -- your counter, your floor, your social life -- but your happiness level will surely be punched up.</p>  <p>Brandy Punch -- ""Here's How"" (1941)</p>  <p>Serves 20</p>  <p>""It's a drink you can remember -- if you CAN remember""</p>  <p>3 quarts brandy</p>  <p>1/2 pint Jamaican rum</p>  <p>1 gill curacao</p>  <p>1 gallon water</p>  <p>6 lemons (juice only)</p>  <p>3 oranges</p>  <p>1 pineapple</p>  <p>1/2 pint raspberries</p>  <p>Mix the liquors and pour into punch bowl containing large piece of ice.

They have been trained to support children who deviate from gender norms, whether it's a boy in girls' clothes or a child who was born a girl and wants to be called a boy. And, they know it's school policy.</p>  <p>""Diversity is a good thing. We all benefit from the unique characteristics that we all have,"" Pollock said. ""Our goal is to build a culture of inclusivity and understanding and a mindset of being welcoming to everyone.""</p>  <p>Across the country, schools are adopting similar mantras for transgender and gender nonconforming children in their mission statements and policies. Advocates say the efforts reflect growing support for research showing the negative effects of enforcing fixed ideas of what it means to be a boy or a girl on children, especially in learning environments.</p>  <p>""This is the reality in which we live: Gender is a continuum, not a box,"" said Graciela Slesaransky-Poe , dean of Arcadia University's School of Education in Pennsylvania. Her experience with a gender-nonconforming child led her to become a consultant who has helped schools across the country learn to accommodate children who are opening up about gender identity as early as kindergarten.</p>  <p>""We need to be sure we don't create structures and artifices to reinforce binaries that limit and constrain the ways in which we behave and express ourselves.""</p>  <p>The right to an education free of discrimination based on gender identity is protected by federal, state, and local laws. The US Department of Education in April reaffirmed a 2010 declaration that ""Title IX's sex discrimination prohibition extends to claims of discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity."" Massachusetts and California are among the growing number of states with strong legal protections for transgender and gender nonconforming students. At least 160 cities and have passed laws prohibiting gender identity discrimination, according to advocacy group Gender Spectrum . Wisconsin's Madison Metropolitan School District is one of many districts to issue guidance to administrators for creating a welcoming environment for transgender and gender nonconforming students.</p>  <p>The efforts are not always welcomed by the community. Opponents of California AB 1266 are working to get it on the ballot for veto referendum . This week, a Nebraska parent raised objections over training for Lincoln Public School staff about lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender issues.</p>  <p>In an email to parents, the mother cited handouts, including one called ""12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness"" that recommended against ""gendered"" expressions such as ""boys and girls,"" the Lincoln Journal Star reported . The mother and school district did not respond to CNN's request for comment.</p>  <p>""By sidelining academic teacher training and replacing it with social re-engineering, the LPS administration has placed a higher priority on social reformation than on education,"" the mother said in an ""introductory speech"" prepared for an upcoming school board meeting, according to documents obtained by the Journal Star .</p>  <p>Advocates say improving school climate and legal protections are important because transgender and gender nonconforming children are frequent targets of bullying. A 2012 survey found that 42% of gender nonconforming students feel safe at school, compared to 62% of their gender conforming counterparts. More than 40% of students who participated in a 2005 National School Climate Survey felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression; 26% said they were physically harassed the previous year because of their gender expression.</p>  <p>""The work that we do is not to make schools safer just for transgender students, but to make schools safe for everyone regardless of where they fall on the gender spectrum,"" said Kim Westheimer, director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Family Project's Welcoming Schools initiative. The program helps schools, such as Garden Oaks Montessori, create an inclusive climate through staff training, policy recommendations, and bullying prevention approaches.</p>  <p>Creating a welcoming environment is an ongoing process that involves various stakeholders from the school community. Here are some steps that educators, parents and advocacy groups recommend for creating a gender inclusive school community.</p>  <p>1. Don't separate children by gender</p>  <p>When it's time to work in groups, experts recommend coming up with alternatives for separating children. The first letters of their last names, birthday months, clothing colors or types of pets they own are just some ways to do it, but many more exist.</p>  <p>Separating by categories other than gender helps children identify and build relationships based on common ground -- or, at the very least, start conversations. In other words, it helps them learn to relate to others based on similarities (and differences) other than gender.</p>  <p>2. Start the day with inclusive language and stick with it</p>  <p>Instead of saying ""good morning, boys and girls,"" experts recommend using broader language to convey a sense of equality and togetherness. Again, a variety of alternatives exist, such ""good morning, class"" or ""good morning, everyone.""</p>  <p>Using inclusive language throughout the day reinforces the idea that boys and girls are not limited by their biology to succeed in the same arenas, said Rhonda Thomason with Welcoming Schools. Often, we imply that boys or girls are only good at specific things through the subtle (and not-so-subtle) things we say, or the activities we nudge them toward.</p>  <p>3. Feature diversity in books, posters and other workbooks</p>  <p>Welcoming Schools , Gender Spectrum and TransYouth Family Allies offer bibliographies and other resources for classroom materials featuring diversity in various forms.</p>  <p>A wide selection of children's books feature transgender and gender expansive children. Many more feature men and women in nonstereotypical roles of all races and sexual orientation; the same goes for posters that hang in classrooms.</p>  <p>4. Create a professional development plan to help educators</p>  <p>Some schools devote several administrative prep days to familiarizing staff with issues surrounding transgender and gender variant children. After all, teachers set classroom tone through language and lesson plans. They also can intervene in instances of bullying or name-calling and, when appropriate, use them as teachable moments.</p>  <p>In order to act, experts say educators need to develop a shared understanding of gender identity and language to be able to communicate with students and parents. But they need to know what to look for, and they need to believe that they have the support of the school, which leads to the next suggestion.</p>  <p>5. Have strong policies to support transgender students</p>  <p>Some schools may not know what do if a child who was referred to by male pronouns now uses female pronouns. What does that mean in the classroom, or on their transcript?</p>  <p>Policies should address how to handle names and pronouns, bathroom use, extracurricular activities, student records, and confidentiality, said Westheimer with Welcoming Schools. These issues can be complicated, so best to consult an expert in your area or national organizations such as Welcoming Schools , Gender Spectrum or TransYouth Family Allies .</p>  <p>6. Engage the entire school community</p>  <p>Each school approaches this differently. One school in Maine sent a letter home to parents informing them that a second-grader who identified as a girl the previous year would be recognized as a boy this year. Others incorporate the discussion into class or school-wide meetings.</p>  <p>The goal is the same: to set community norms for what's expected and create a platform for people to ask questions.</p> "

A BabyCenter article on the picture was shared 2,600 times from its Facebook page , drawing nearly 15,000 likes. In the past week, the Gardners' Facebook page , where they share news about their pregnancy, grew by nearly 16,000 likes to 24,300.</p>  <p>Ashley Gardner shared some thoughts via email with CNN about her experience with infertility and becoming an internet sensation.</p>  <p>CNN: What other methods did you try before IVF?</p>  <p>Ashley Gardner: We tried EVERYTHING under the sun. We tried for 8 long years (taking a few months of here and there to keep our sanity!) our efforts included, diet, a surgery on my end (laparoscopy), medications then onto 4 fails IUI's and then we saved up for IVF and BAM! It worked really really really REALLY well!</p>  <p>Record number of women using IVF to get pregnant</p>  <p>CNN: What made you decide to start sharing your journey on Facebook?</p>  <p>Gardner: So about a year and a half ago I decided to open up about our infertility struggles. It was getting hard getting asked ALL THE TIME why I didn't have children yet. I was sick of making excuses for something that was out of my control and emotionally affecting me so much. I opened up and couldn't believe the outpouring support I started getting from EVERYONE! Even people I didn't know. It was an amazing feeling to not be hiding this awful disease of infertility anymore and openly talking about it! I found that so many others were going through the same thing! And I've since been able to help so many others struggling and feeling so alone during this heartbreaking journey.</p>  <p>As for our Facebook page , my awesome sister Whitney set that up for me when we announced that we were having quads. We just announced on our private pages to our friends and family and the picture was so priceless that everyone started sharing it and we started getting hundreds of friend requests from people we didn't know. So we did the Facebook page so that everyone can follow our story and we can still keep our personal Facebook pages for ourselves.</p>  <p>CNN: Do you remember what was going through your mind when you found out you had quads?</p>  <p>Gardner: ""OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!"" I couldn't think straight! I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant. We waited so long to have babies so we were so happy... But at that time we literally had NEVER even thought once about this being a possibility. We didn't know anything about having quads and the risks that go with it. But overall, we were just excited!!!! My husband is the oldest of 10 children so he is ready to take on anything! He can calm any baby and entertain any kid. They love him. He is the favorite uncle to all our nieces and nephews. We are ready! Our doctors say that everything is in our favor for this going great. Doesn't mean it won't be hard. But we can handle it!</p>  <p>Identical quadruplets surprise mom expecting triplets</p>  <p>CNN: Dumb question: Were you surprised?</p>  <p>Gardner: YES!!!! After eight long, heartbreaking years of infertility and every month passing by with a negative pregnancy test you do get discouraged! You hold on to as much hope as you can and sometimes you lose it. But you dust yourself off get up and try again!</p>  <p>My endometriosis (cause of our infertility) was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs. Out of all the eggs they got they all started dying off and left us with 1 perfect egg and one good egg. They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking so we would at least get one baby out of this since I didn't have any eggs to freeze and this was probably our last shot at this. The chances of even getting one to stick was 40%. To have both stick and both split... well, that's a 1 in 70 million chance!</p>  <p>It was meant to be!</p>  <p>CNN: Do you have any idea how the photos got picked up and started going ""viral""?</p>  <p>Gardner: Only thing I can think of is what I stated above.

The premise: When Shadyside High School senior Brendan Fear has a birthday party at his parent's summer house on Fear Island, things go from bad to worse.</p>  <p>Stine, 70, is the author of more than 300 novels for children and teens, including the much-loved ""Goosebumps"" and ""Fear Street"" series. The latter was a major hit, selling 80 million copies and building a fan base that for years has been asking him to revive the spooky series.</p>  <p>""The whole thing happened because of Twitter,"" Stine said. ""It's a great way to keep in touch with my original readers, and 'Fear Street' was mentioned more than anything else. That's what they read when they were kids. And I suppose we're all nostalgic for what we read back then.""</p>  <p>R.L. Stine aims to give adults 'Goosebumps'</p>  <p>The new ""Fear Street"" arrives at a time many consider to be a renaissance of young adult horror. It disappeared as a dominant genre in the early 2000s with the rise of fantasy novels and series such as ""Harry Potter"" and ""Eragon."" Popular shows such as ""The Walking Dead"" and ""American Horror Story"" helped revive interest in horror literature, said Catherine Scully , young adult editor for the Horror Writers Association .</p>  <p>Like today's TV shows, today's teen horror novels are darker and scarier than the ""Fear Street"" of the 1990s, reflecting the way popular culture has changed. Along with Stine, a new class of authors is attempting to redefine young adult horror for the ""Saw"" generation, which can easily find graphic depictions of violence on TV and in movies and video games. By weaving in diverse elements -- such as historic gothic and psychological thrillers -- and making both protagonists and villains more three-dimensional, this new wave of authors is hoping to appeal to readers looking for something more than gore and torture porn.</p>  <p>Unlike horror depicted on television and the big screen, in horror literature for young adults, subtlety is key, rather than shock value, author and horror expert Jonathan Maberry said.</p>  <p>""Modern teen horror goes more inside the personal experience rather than the body count,"" he said. ""The more subtle you go and leave for the reader to interpret, they can participate and it's even scarier.""</p>  <p>A brief history of young adult literature</p>  <p>Where it began, where it's going .</p>  <p>The definition of teen horror can be difficult to pinpoint, especially as new authors broaden the range of topics contained within the genre. In the broadest sense, it embodies the disturbing, imaginative manifestations of fear and dread, life-or-death situations, thrilling surprises and a loss of control, authors and literary observers say.</p>  <p>Horror is defined by what scares you, ""and that's very personal and different for each person,"" said Scully, who reviews young adult horror in HWA's 'Scary Out There' blog .</p>  <p>Horror novels by Stine, Christopher Pike and Lois Duncan emerged as a salve to the 1970s and 1980s' ""problem novels"" that dealt with divorce, drugs and alcohol abuse. In the early 2000s, authors began began weaving elements of horror into fantasy, such as the ""Harry Potter"" series. Horror was the umbrella genre that gave birth to popular subgenres such as paranormal and dystopian, Scully said.</p>  <p>As the genre evolved, it began attracting more readers with its diversity of subgenres and topics. Themes of empowerment and hope emerged, showcasing teens defeating evil in the face of their greatest fears -- and surviving to the end of the book, Scully said.</p>  <p>Readers sound off: Books that changed YOUR lives</p>  <p>""I look at YA horror as being the swords and shields we give our teens to fight with these problems that we have limited ways of coping with,"" Scully said. ""Teen horror stories are actually empowering them against these horrific things in their life. To have their own stories and their own ways of fighting back, I think we give them a voice.""</p>  <p>Cat Winters , Kendare Blake , April Genevieve Tucholke and Kami Garcia are some of the authors folding in suspense and elements of psychological terror into horror novels.</p>  <p>""Horror combines what readers love by merging the scary creatures from 'Twilight' and gritty, horrifying elements of dystopian (literature),"" gothic horror author Winters said. ""Horror can be a genre of its own but finds its way into almost every other genre.""</p>  <p>Kenneth Oppel, author of a young Victor Frankenstein series , believes that part of the appeal of modern young adult horror is the shift away from crazed serial killers to demons within ourselves. Case in point: zombies, monsters of our own creation.</p>  <p>Zombies connect well with the teen experience, standing as a metaphor for misunderstanding, loss or massive life changes and how characters handle the consequences, Maberry said.</p>  <p>Isaac Marion, author of ""Warm Bodies,"" which was adapted for the big screen in February 2013, didn't write his book for young adults. But they connected with the message: figuring out who you are and who you want to be, even if you're a zombie, he said. His book is told from the perspective of a zombie who feels lost until he meets (and doesn't want to eat) a living person.</p>  <p>""It always seemed strange to me that there was no curiosity about what's going on behind the scenes of this creature,"" Marion said.</p>  <p>Young adult books from page to screen</p>  <p>New twists to old favorite s</p>  <p>For years, fans have been asking Stine to revive ""Fear Street"" in online fan forums and over social media.</p>  <p>But publishers weren't interested, claiming the idea he left behind in 1995 was outdated in the new world of young adult fiction dominated by dystopian worlds and paranormal events. Stine took to Twitter, thanking his fans for their interest while letting them know that the idea was discouraged.</p>  <p>Then, associate editor Kat Brzozowski of Thomas Dunne Books, a division of St. Martin's Press, reached out to him.</p>  <p>The ""Fear Street"" series married supernatural horror with real-life horror of teenagers' deepest fears and insecurities. That's why they were so popular with young readers, Brzozowski said, including herself. She thought it was fitting that the grandfather of teen horror revisit his most popular series for old fans and a new generation.</p>  <p>Young adult books that changed our lives</p>  <p>While the Stine ""recipe"" remains the same -- following one character's perspective closely -- Stine says the new ""Fear Street"" books will be longer, more adult and more violent, reflecting how young adult fiction has changed since the 1990s.</p>  <p>""For me, it's thinking of new scares, plot twists and cliffhanger chapter endings I haven't done before, moving into the modern world,"" Stine said.

Instead, be gentle and methodical. Treat the stain as soon as you can; the less time that elapses, the more success you'll have. And always use a white cloth so that colors can't transfer. Dab, rather than rub, working from the outside in to keep the stain contained.</p>  <p>Mistake 2: Using too much d etergent</p>  <p>Excess suds can hold dirt pulled from clothes and get caught in areas that won't always rinse clean, like under a collar, leading to bacteria buildup. The remedy: Use only half the amount of detergent that you normally do, then gradually increase that amount if your clothes are not coming out as clean as you would like. An exception: If you have hard water, you may actually need more soap than you are using. Check the recommendation for hard water on your detergent bottle.</p>  <p>RealSimple.com: Laundry room organizing ideas</p>  <p>Mistake 3: Filling the washing machine i ncorrectly</p>  <p>When washing in a top-loader with liquid detergent, you should first fill with water, then add soap, then add clothes, right? Well, no. This protocol from the past was meant to prevent residue on the fabric and the machine. But modern detergents are phosphate-free and not harmful to clothes the way old formulas were. As long as you're not using bleach, don't add clothing after the water (a pain, because clothes can float). Instead, use this order to distribute detergent best: clothes, then water, then soap.</p>  <p>Mistake 4: Washing an item that has a ""dry-clean"" l abel</p>  <p>This isn't necessarily a blunder. Most items that say ""dry-clean"" can be hand-washed and air-dried. This includes natural fibers, such as linen and most silks. First check for colorfastness; moisten a cotton swab with mild detergent and dab it on a hidden seam to see if any dye comes off. If not, go ahead and dunk the garment in soapy water just once or twice, then rinse and immediately roll it in a towel to extract moisture. However, you should stick with dry-cleaning for certain categories: leather, suede, silk dupioni, anything with embellishments and structured pieces (like blazers).</p>  <p>Mistake 5: Not zipping zippers all the way to the t op</p>  <p>Metal teeth can snag delicate and woven clothing that's being washed in the same load.</p>  <p>RealSimple.com: The best specialized laundry detergents</p>  <p>Mistake 6: Washing shirts all buttoned u p</p>  <p>This seems like a good idea, but it can stress buttons and buttonholes and lead to premature poppage. Take the time to unbutton before tossing clothes in the washer (or the hamper).</p>  <p>Mistake 7: Overusing b leach</p>  <p>Think twice before you reach for the bleach: You actually don't need it to get rid of protein stains, like blood, sweat and tears. (Okay, maybe tears are not a big laundry issue.) One natural option: Toss stained socks, tees and undies into a big pot of water with a few lemon slices and bring to a boil for a few minutes.</p>  <p>RealSimple.com: New uses for old laundry things</p>  <p>Mistake 8: Not leveling your washing m achine</p>  <p>If your washer is not level, vibrations can damage your floor and prematurely wear out key components, like the shock absorbers and the tub bearings. (Plus, there's that terrible noise.) Place a level on top of the machine and adjust the feet, which typically screw up and down, accordingly. If this doesn't help, beef up the floor with a 3/4-inch-thick piece of plywood that's a little larger than the machine's base. It will help absorb vibrations.</p>  <p>RealSimple.com: 33 modern design ideas for the living room</p>  <p>Mistake 9: Letting the dryer ""rest"" between l oads</p>  <p>Some folks like to wait an hour after one cycle concludes before putting in a new load. But in fact, running back-to-back dryer loads is smart and efficient. It lets you take advantage of retained heat from the previous cycle, cutting down on energy usage.</p>  <p>RealSimple.com: 11 bedroom makeovers</p>  <p>Mistake 10: Ignoring the permanent press setting on your d ryer</p>  <p>This medium-heat cycle with a cool-down period at the end is a proven crease curber. More tips: Don't pack clothes in; they need to float freely or they'll wrinkle. (Note: Ditto for the washer. Stuffing it can create wrinkles and prevent your clothes from getting clean. On top of that, it can put pressure on the machine's bearings and shock absorbers, causing them to wear down prematurely.) And procrastinators, take note: It really does eliminate creases if you fold clothes when they're still hot, right out of the dryer (or, if you prefer, right out of the pile that you dumped onto your bed).

"272","Can a law requiring 'yes' for sex work?","CNN.com","2014-10-01 22:57:54","2014-10-06 06:09:55","http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/01/opinion/schwartz-california-consent-yes-sex-law/index.html","Living"," <p>The law requires state colleges and universities to require ""affirmative consent"" from everyone engaged in sexual activity. Consent ""must be ongoing throughout."" The law specifies that silence and lack of protest makes consent impossible, and drunkenness is not an excuse.</p>  <p>But this step-by-step consent plan is just not the way hot and heavy sex generally proceeds on college campuses. And it falls apart when you consider that a lot of sex on campus happens when people are drunk. That's the real problem. Except for truly malignant or misguided offenders -- ""she asked for it"" kind of guys -- most sexual calamities happen when students are drinking.</p>  <p>In a study by American Sociological Association President Paula England , students reported a mean of six drinks for men and four drinks for women on their last ""'hook up."" That's just the tip of the iceberg, and that's what we should be addressing: the over-drinking and under socialization about what makes sex worthwhile and why unconscious sex is not in anyone's best interests.</p>  <p></p>  <p>But instead of dealing with the real problem, legislators are going to have a standard of conduct that most dating couples or people who meet at a party will not follow. This won't be a problem -- until someone believes he or she did not give a specific permission. If it sounds like an easy thing to do, remember how you were in your late teens and 20s and you might recall that being articulate during sex is not so easy.</p>  <p>Legislating sex on campus</p>  <p>Will people really ask permission as they make the transition from oral sex to intercourse if their partner seems to be enthusiastically joining in? Unlikely. And if both partners are drunk, is one more culpable than the other? I applaud the idea that both partners should be conscious, but do you think young men who throw a fraternity party think nobody will drink too much? And do the young women who go to these parties expect to stay sober?</p>  <p>If we want to make rules about something, we should try to make rules about these parties. That might work. And we should try to educate young people about how easy it is to ruin their lives when they are drunk. But who are we going to punish if it's a one-on-one encounter, both parties are drunk -- or not -- and each has different ideas of what was said?</p>  <p>As the professor of many university students and the mother of a girl and a boy who thankfully made it out of their 20s with no sexual and emotional scars, I worried about both my students and my kids in these years: I feared my daughter might get in a tough situation with a sexually aggressive date or that my son might be wrongfully accused by someone he didn't want to date any longer, or by a partner who changed her mind about what happened after a big night of partying. My fears were not baseless: I heard many examples of these kinds of situations.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Still, in our effort to protect the sexual victimization of women, we create a standard that is probably impossible to produce all the time. I am not convinced that young women cannot be given the tools to say no, and men cannot learn how to accept that answer.</p>  <p>I think most young men want to be wanted and proceed when they think they are. Yes, there are rapists who think they are wanted and that it's just incidental that they have a knife in their hand when she consents. But these are the criminal and pathological minds that not only won't follow this regime, they won't even think it applies to them. Other measures of avoidance and protection are necessary to save women from sociopaths. It's laughable to think this kind of predator would even notice, much less follow, these rules.</p>  <p></p>  <p>So who are they for? The guys who might misunderstand what a woman wants and find themselves mystified when charges are brought against them? Will these rules protect them? Probably not, because I think those guys will believe that their partner's behavior says it all. What would you do if you kissed someone passionately and he or she responded in kind? Would you ask permission before you began to use your tongue?</p>  <p></p>  <p>I'm not saying no one can do this. I think many smart and caring men and women do ask permission along the way and are careful and sensitive observers of what their partner wants and says. I'm all for encouraging that kind of protection of oneself and one's partner. But I think most of this would be clear and careful if it weren't happening in an alcoholic fog, and that's where I'd put my money and educational efforts.</p>  <p>Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine</p>  <p>Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.</p>  <p>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion</p> "

(If you're not and you're making some anyway, I salute your life and the way you live it.) Punch should be a lavishly flowing thing, spilling out past the bounds of a mere cocktail shaker. Pitcher? Pah! You're thinking too small. Commandeer your largest cooking pot -- or a punch bowl if you're blessed enough to possess such a thing. Ladle from it with love.</p>  <p>Food52: Rum Punch</p>  <p>But most righteous are those who bypass traditional kitchenware completely and opt for the trash can. In goes the Everclear (dude, there's gotta be Everclear), the contents of the lowest shelf at the liquor store (rum's good, so is vodka, and that weird, off-brand non-Kentucky whiskey that comes in a plastic handle and smells of dorm carpet) and fruit. Gotta be some fruit -- both juiced and whole. No one is getting scurvy, rickets or any other dread pirate diseases on your watch, Captain. Cheers.</p>  <p>Food52: Bumble Brown Punch</p>  <p>Think you're too fancy or grown-up for punch? You deserve no punch. Your Red Solo cup or vintage, cut-crystal glass will be confiscated, and you are hereby sentenced to flat beer and warm vodka tonics until you realize the error of your ways. Punch is an invitation to share in an event, jump into the current, bob to the surface and float merrily with the rest of the crowd. If someone hands you a cup of punch when you walk into their home, backyard or random parking lot, the tone is set and you may as well sing along. (And if you don't drink booze, man, that's cool, too. Totally cool. Stick an umbrella or some hunks of fruit in there for extra festiveness and party the heck on.)</p>  <p>Tips for great party punch</p>  <p>Punch makes a host's life simple, and allows him or her to come across quite hospitably. Mix up a massive batch ahead of time (most are even better when they have a chance to meld for a while), set up a filling station and you're good to go, libation-wise. It's easy enough to scoop out a serving and meet guests at the front door (or over by that guy's station wagon) with a welcome beverage, or allow them to meet over by the punch bowl (or can). Moreover, it leaves a host free to slip through the crowd, mixing, chatting, collecting empties and generally making a splash at this well-lubricated affair.</p>  <p>Food52: Gingered Lemon Punch</p>  <p>And yes, yes -- punch can go pinky-up, topped with champagne and full of mixologically clever macerations. It sure can, and it's fantastic when that happens, but it has to deliver on the implicit promise of punch. There should rightly be a small phalanx of empty spirits bottles to be hauled away after deployment -- not to mention the husks of spent fruit, juiced of all their usefulness or booze-soaked and suited for snacking on in the wee (wheeee!) small hours.</p>  <p>Food52: Apple Rye Punch</p>  <p>Things may be a little sticky the next day -- your counter, your floor, your social life -- but your happiness level will surely be punched up.</p>  <p>Brandy Punch -- ""Here's How"" (1941)</p>  <p>Serves 20</p>  <p>""It's a drink you can remember -- if you CAN remember""</p>  <p>3 quarts brandy</p>  <p>1/2 pint Jamaican rum</p>  <p>1 gill curacao</p>  <p>1 gallon water</p>  <p>6 lemons (juice only)</p>  <p>3 oranges</p>  <p>1 pineapple</p>  <p>1/2 pint raspberries</p>  <p>Mix the liquors and pour into punch bowl containing large piece of ice.

Now 70, Wegman has dabbled in various mediums and themes since introducing the world to Man Ray , his first pet Weimaraner, in the 1970s.</p>  <p>But his choice of muse has remained fairly constant throughout his art, and even in the dog bed he helped design.</p>  <p>""He's the reason so many people know about these dogs,"" said Betsy Bottomley, who brought her 7-year-old rescue Weimaraner, Chance, to see Wegman at a recent author talk at the Decatur Book Festival in Georgia.</p>  <p>""Weimaraners are very people-oriented,"" she said. ""They love days like this when they can be outside with their families.""</p>  <p>Wegman was at the festival to promote ""Flo & Wendell Explore,"" his newest children's book inspired by his blue-eyed pet Weimeraners, Flo and Topper . They're the latest in a long line of Wegman's canine muses that have inspired a robust collection of paintings, photographs, films, books and worldwide exhibits.</p>  <p>Wegman has had 3-year-old Flo and 2-year-old Topper since both were 8 weeks old. They share the Wegman home with 13-year-old Candy and 15-year-old Bobbin, a descendant of Fay Wray , one of his most famous subjects.</p>  <p>""Topper didn't seem like a little boy's name. Wendell seemed to suit the look,"" Wegman said in a post-panel interview in a nearby hotel lobby, pulling out his iPhone to show off pictures like a proud parent.</p>  <p>""How could you not do a book about her?"" he said, pausing on a closeup of of Flo. ""She's so captivating.""</p>  <p>The follow-up to ""Flo & Wendell"" features a combination of paintings and photographs, a departure from the images of dogs in costumes and roller skates for which Wegman is perhaps best known.</p>  <p>It's a format that suits his current lifestyle and artistic sensibilities, he said. It allows him to ditch the studio and production crews needed to stage shoots of dogs dressed as Little Red Riding Hood or the Hardly Boys . Instead, he can paint the backdrop to Flo and Wendell's adventures beneath the skylight in his lakeside home in Maine.</p>  <p>""It was great, because I could be by myself in my room, like I was when I was a little boy, drawing pictures,"" he said, referring to his childhood in western Massachusetts.</p>  <p>Wegman shared the book festival stage with author-illustrator Chris Gall for a discussion about why animals make such great subjects for books. Every dog has its own personality, which guides how Wegman portrays them, he said.</p>  <p>He told the festival audience -- a mix of adults and children -- that he approaches children's picture books the same way as everything else he does. He just makes art, using dogs.</p>  <p>""I love the idea that Wegman isn't thinking about picture books any differently from his adult work, that he's approaching his books for kids with the same kinds of ideas and aesthetic concerns,"" said author and panel moderator Laurel Snyder.</p>  <p>""He seems to be an artist by nature and an author by default, and it shows.""</p>  <p>Wegman knows it, too. At best, he's a ""part-time"" children's book author, a fact that became apparent to him in the company of established children's authors at the book festival.</p>  <p>""I don't have a TV show. You're not going to have a huge following unless you have a franchise or a creature -- something that gets in your imagination, whereas I just kind of dabble in children's books,"" he said.</p>  <p>""Everything that I do is sort of that way,"" he said. ""I think it's a product of being an artist in the '60s, where switching mediums was not alien.""</p>  <p>Don't get Wegman wrong -- he loves children. He has two children of his own that he also likes to show off in pictures on his iPhone doing winter sports like ice skating and playing hockey.</p>  <p>He also likes creating art with children, which he occasionally does in schools. They don't care about impressing William Wegman the artist -- even his appearances on ""Sesame Street"" with Fay Wray are too far in the past to register with them.</p>  <p>""They don't care about doing a William Wegman piece. They just want to do a Darth Vader piece, or disco dog,"" he said. ""Their language is mesmerizing.""</p>  <p>If he could be anywhere, unsurprisingly, he'd be spending time with his dogs in the country, or taking photos of them in New York, where he spends about half the year.</p>  <p>Dogs' personalities shine through in front of the camera, he said. It was true for Man Ray, who became ""very calm and interested"" when Wegman would point a camera at him. Same goes for Flo and Topper, who ""loves to be on top of things.""</p>  <p>""You really fall in love with them taking their pictures,"" he said. ""You learn so much about them.""</p> "

It could come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, ""enthusiastic"" and ongoing.</p>  <p>To Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for the teen publication Sex, Etc. , it was a refreshing stance for a school to endorse.</p>  <p>""I loved hearing that, because I'd never really heard people describe consent in that manner before,"" she said. ""Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing.""</p>  <p>It's a message students across the country are hearing as they return to campus for a new semester. Often referred to as affirmative consent, it's the concept of both parties agreeing to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures.</p>  <p>""There are lots of ways to express 'yes.' My favorite is 'yes,'"" a speaker told the Berkeley freshmen .</p>  <p>California might become the first state to make affirmative consent law. Senate Bill 967 would amend the education code to require schools whose students receive financial aid to uphold an affirmative consent standard in disciplinary hearings and to educate students about the standard. The legislature sent the bill to Gov. Jerry Brown last week.</p>  <p>The legislation has the support of victims' rights groups, violence prevention groups and the University of California System. But critics worry it could define a great deal of sexual activity as ""sexual assault"" and undermine due process rights of the accused.</p>  <p>Even if Brown vetoes the legislation, consent will still be defined on the University of California's 10 campuses as an ""affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.""</p>  <p>MORE: Why vomiting on your attacker won't prevent rape</p>  <p>What that looks like in practice is harder to explain, leaving institutions grappling with how to make the policy more meaningful than words in a student handbook.</p>  <p>""There's varying language, but the language gets to the core of people having to communicate their affirmation to participate in sexual behavior,"" said Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault . ""It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about sexual assault. It's requiring us to say women and men should be mutually agreeing and actively participating in sexual behavior.""</p>  <p>A laughing matter?</p>  <p>It's a shift schools have endorsed before with mixed results.</p>  <p>Ohio's Antioch College became a target of national mockery after revising its Sexual Offense Prevention Policy in 1993 to require that students give ongoing verbal consent at each stage of intimacy.</p>  <p>The policy reads today much as it did then: ""Consent means verbally asking and verbally giving or denying consent for all levels of sexual behavior.""</p>  <p>Consent is required regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity (""Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity,"" the policy reads). It cannot be given if the person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.</p>  <p>The rule was mocked in a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit featuring Phil Hartman as the host of the game show ""Is It Date Rape?"" The ""date rape players"" acted out encounters that Antioch students (played by Shannen Doherty and Chris Farley) called out as ""date rape"" or ""not date rape.""</p>  <p>The ""date rape players"" talked like ""robots,"" using cold and clinical language, said Louise Smith, Antioch dean of community life. In reality, ""good communication between sexual partners can be fun, even sexy,"" she said.</p>  <p>""If you think about it not in the SNL kind of way, but as a conversation that's ongoing as things progress, it can work,"" Smith said.</p>  <p>The school, which closed in 2008 and reopened in 2011, has no empirical way of measuring the policy's success, said Smith, an Antioch alum. But the school feels vindicated by SB 967 and renewed dialogue around consent.</p>  <p>""Despite the fact we were ridiculed, we were extremely proud of this policy. We felt like it was forward-thinking and in line with our values about social justice, equality and health.""</p>  <p>Meanwhile, affirmative consent continues to be fodder for sitcoms and sketch comedy shows , highlighting the ""profound disconnect between the policy's bureaucratic requirements"" and the reality of human sexuality, said Joseph Cohn, legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a legal advocacy group that has come out against the legislation.</p>  <p>The disconnect underscores ""the serious difficulty that passage of SB 967 would present to campus administrators across California,"" he said. ""Under this legislation, students who are or may become sexually active must now worry about documenting that they obtained consent, because proving affirmative consent is the only way to defend oneself before a campus tribunal.""</p>  <p>Rewriting the rules of consent</p>  <p>It's no laughing matter to survivors, feminists and prevention specialists, who have long pushed for schools to enforce some form of affirmative consent policy, not only as the moral code governing student conduct, but the standard of proof used in disciplinary proceedings.</p>  <p>Now it's starting to gain traction on college campuses amid pressure from advocacy groups and the federal government to do more to prevent sexual violence.</p>  <p>Schools nationwide are in the process of rewriting or have already rewritten their sexual assault policies, procedures and prevention education programs to meet standards in the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act , known as the Campus SaVE Act. That took effect in 2013 as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act , said Tracey Vitchers with Students Active for Ending Rape , which assists student-led campaigns to reform college sexual assault policies.</p>  <p>More: Violence Against Women Act shines light on same-sex abuse</p>  <p>The White House further signaled its support for the issue this year through the formation of the Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault. Its goal is to help schools improve policies and protocol for preventing and dealing with sexual misconduct so they comply with the Campus SaVE Act.</p>  <p>One of the task force's recommendations for revising sexual misconduct policies included defining consent as a ""voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity."" Past consent should not imply consent, nor should silence or the absence of resistance, the guidelines recommend .</p>  <p>To reach compliance with the Violence Against Women Act, the California State University and University of California systems in February adopted standards similar to those in SB 967, including affirmative consent, spokeswoman Dianne Klein said.</p>  <p>""We've been working on these issues for quite a while. Is it perfect? No. But we are confident that we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so.""</p>  <p>Berkeley also was revising its orientation program before the White House task force recommendations, based on student feedback and guidance from the federal government, spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said. In addition to Bear Pact, students are required to take online awareness-building programs on alcohol use and sexual harassment.</p>  <p>More: Survivor-led activist movement leads fight against campus rape</p>  <p>But is it enough? The sexual harassment component of Bear Pact evolved from existing consent education workshops offered at Berkeley since 2011 called ""EmpowerU."" The smaller, in-person workshops covered affirmative consent by walking through various scenarios, followed by group discussions.</p>  <p>While making Bear Pact mandatory and emphasizing affirmative consent are positive steps, some worry that expanding the presentation into a large lecture format reduces its effectiveness. For Bear Pact, the 90-minute EmpowerU workshop was compressed into a 45-minute lecture with no time for discussion.</p>  <p>Berkeley student and Bear Pact speaker Meghan Warner would like to see consent education continue beyond orientation and sexual harassment workshops and into classrooms and academic curricula.</p>  <p>""We still have a long way to go,"" said Warner, who works in sexual violence prevention through a number of roles with the Associated Students of the University of California and the Greek System.</p>  <p>""I think it's a great step in the right direction, but I don't think it's sufficient to educate someone for the rest of their life.""</p>  <p>Creating positive models of consent</p>  <p>Typical lessons about consent focus on what it does not look like. Most students learn at some point in their postsecondary careers that by law, consent cannot be given under the influence of drugs or alcohol or if someone is asleep or unconscious. In other words, sex under the influence can be considered nonconsensual, which is the definition of rape.</p>  <p>Through presentations and workshops, social media campaigns and fliers posted on campus, schools also are trying to impress upon students that consent should be ""enthusiastic,"" ""voluntary"" and ""unambiguous."" It can even be ""sexy.""</p>  <p>But affirmative consent rules won't stop someone intent on committing sexual assault. Sexual violence is still a problem even at schools that promote affirmative consent, including Berkeley. Berkeley is one of 76 schools under investigation by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for violations of Title IX, the federal law that grants students access to education free of gender-based discrimination and harassment.</p>  <p>Enforcing an affirmative consent standard alone in schools will not fix the system, said Berkeley senior Sofie Karasek, one of 31 students who filed a Title IX complaint against the school in February. It takes a multipronged approach: trained counselors to support survivors, investigators to thoroughly examine cases, and a timely hearing process -- all required under federal law and included in SB 967.</p>  <p>The affirmative consent clause of SB 967 generates headlines, but supporters of the bill champion its comprehensive approach, which mirrors Title IX requirements. SB 967 also requires schools to implement comprehensive prevention programs and survivor-centered sexual assault response policies and protocols. It calls on schools to form partnerships with community organizations to assist survivors.</p>  <p>The affirmative consent standard helps by shifting the burden in disciplinary hearings from the complainant, who had to prove assault occurred, to the accused, who must show that he or she sought consent, Karasek said.</p>  <p>""There's this underlying assumption, unlike in any other crime, that survivors are lying or overexaggerating,"" Karasek said. ""Having an affirmative consent standard changes the dynamic because we're not automatically assuming that if someone didn't say no, it means yes.""</p>  <p>The flipped dynamic is what concerns critics of SB 967. Under an affirmative consent standard, sexual activity is sexual assault unless the accused can prove that the accusing party consciously and voluntarily agreed to engage in sexual activity. Moreover, the accused student must prove that the consent was ongoing, said Cohn, with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.</p>  <p>""When 'affirmative consent' becomes law, there will be no practical, fair, or consistent way for colleges to implement these newly mandated prerequisites for sexual activity,"" Cohn said.</p>  <p>""It is impracticable for the government to require students to obtain affirmative consent at each stage of a physical encounter, especially if students must later prove they successfully did so in a campus hearing. In reality, requiring students to obtain affirmative consent will render a great deal of legal sexual activity 'sexual assault.'""</p>  <p>Consent by whose standard?</p>  <p>To some young men, however, mutual consent is already a familiar concept. Berkeley freshman Alexander Vu attended the same Bear Pact session as Yoon-Hendricks. To him, it sounded like a lot of the same concepts from high school health class.</p>  <p>""It was a good way to reinforce the idea of mutual consent, but it wasn't anything I hadn't heard before,"" the 18-year-old said.</p>  <p>Is it something he would practice? ""Yes, absolutely,"" he said. ""It seems like a good foundation for a healthy, mutually respectful relationship.""</p>  <p>Berkeley freshman Joshua Deng, who also attended the Bear Pact presentation, said he supports the idea of affirmative consent both as a school policy and a rule of thumb to cover him from allegations of wrongdoing.</p>  <p>""I don't want to be forcing someone into a position they're going to be uncomfortable with,"" he said. ""People might say it's impractical or ridiculous in reality, but the possible end of doing something that's not something someone wants is a frightening possibility.""</p>  <p>He stopped short, though, of fully backing affirmative consent as state law.</p>  <p>""I'd have to do more research,"" he said. ""Making a law for anything has huge implications and there's got to be a lot of thinking that goes into that.""</p>  <p>In evaluating sexual misconduct claims, SB 967 calls for schools to apply a ""preponderance of evidence"" standard, similar to Title IX. It's a lower standard of proof, used in civil cases, instead of the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" bar used in criminal trials.</p>  <p>That's another point of contention for people who say SB 967 undermines due process rights by subjecting the accused to a lower culpability threshold without the protections offered by criminal and civil courts -- such as the mandatory exchange of evidence known as discovery and restrictions on hearsay and prior bad act evidence.</p>  <p>""Those accused in campus tribunals are generally denied these protections -- but nevertheless are subject to life-changing sanctions, based on little more than a hunch by campus court participants that one person's story is slightly more credible,"" Cohn said.</p>  <p>Words to love by</p>  <p>Like Berkeley, Columbia University in New York has been the subject of negative publicity in the past year over its handling of sexual misconduct. Just this week, a Columbia student made headlines for vowing to carry around a mattress on which she claims she was raped, until her alleged attacker is disciplined.</p>  <p>Columbia rolled out a new mandatory, two-part workshop for freshmen this semester on sexual violence and gender-based misconduct as part of its New Student Orientation Program.</p>  <p>""Since the beginning of this year the university has been moving on multiple fronts both to respond to student concerns and reflect the changing guidance from the U.S. Department of Education on this issue,"" spokeswoman Victoria Benitez said.</p>  <p>Student activists asked administrators to revise Columbia's ""Consent is Sexy"" workshop last year to make it mandatory and more serious in tone. Attendees told the Columbia Spectator that the presentation focused on defining consent and walking through different scenarios of sexual harassment.</p>  <p>Consent was defined as ""an enthusiastic yes that was gained without the use of intimidation or coercion,"" one attendee told the campus newspaper. The information was thorough and explicit, attendees said, even if it was a little boring and repetitive at times.</p>  <p>Orientation for many students began before they arrived at Columbia, Benitez said. Through newsletters and a video, the school introduced students to its ""Step Up"" and ""Make a Difference"" campaigns on sexual harassment prevention and bystander intervention.</p>  <p>One handout on ""gauging consent"" offers examples of signs that you should stop, such as ""you or your partner are too intoxicated to gauge or give consent"" or ""you hope your partner will say nothing and go with the flow.""</p>  <p>Signs you should pause and talk might be that ""you feel like you are getting mixed signals"" or ""you are not sure what the other person wants.""</p>  <p>Another handout provides students with suggested ways to ask for consent: ""Does this feel good?"" ""Would you like me to...?"" ""Do you want to keep going?""</p>  <p>Framing consent this way serves as a reminder that it can also apply to committed relationships. After all, the vast majority of people who are sexually assaulted know their attacker, and often have a relationship with them, said Laura Palumbo with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center .</p>  <p>Even couples in healthy relationships can benefit from consent, she said.</p>  <p>""If you're in a healthy sexual relationship, wouldn't you want your partner to be as interested in what you're doing as you are? Wouldn't you want the move you're making to be satisfying to your partner?"" she said.</p>  <p>""Our culture is saturated with sex, but we're not given great info about how to talk effectively about sex. We see it on billboards and TV but when we're talking about sexual wants, needs and boundaries, people don't have good language or models for how to approach that.""</p>  <p>Lasting impressions</p>  <p>Time will tell if the orientation workshops, posters and fliers have a lasting impact on students. Yoon-Hendricks said the session at Berkeley made an impression on her, but she acknowledges there was a lot of snickering in the crowd around her.</p>  <p>""To kids who giggle every time someone says sex, I don't think it was as informative as it could've been,"" she said. ""But they did a good job of illustrating the point in a short period of time.""</p>  <p>One thing missing from the presentation? More transparency about Berkeley's history with the issue.</p>  <p>""I think they're trying very, very hard to illustrate the problem on campus. However, they didn't even acknowledge fact that UC system is in trouble because of this issue,"" she said.</p>  <p>""Full disclosure would've been appreciated from most of the students.""</p> "

Changing bodies. Awkward social interactions. No longer a child but not yet an adult. Those are just a few of the zillion reasons why most of us would never want to go back to that time, and why some parents of beginning middle schoolers are freaking out as school starts.</p>  <p>After all, studies have shown that the jump from elementary to middle school can be a painful transition for adolescents, whose worries grow to include greater academic responsibility, burgeoning sexuality and complex social structures.</p>  <p>Lori Garcia, creator of the blog Mommyfriend, admitted she's slightly terrified and definitely anxious about her son, 11, going to junior high school and starting the seventh grade later this month.</p>  <p>READ: OMG! Your teen actually talks to you?</p>  <p>""I remember how difficult the transition was and so not wanting to put those fears on my son I try to speak open-ended about it, like it's a positive experience,"" said Garcia, who experienced ""culture shock"" moving from a Christian elementary school to a public junior high.</p>  <p>""Oh, isn't this exciting,"" Garcia tells her son. ""It's a new adventure, it's a new school, new people, but I do have my concerns.""</p>  <p>Her son has his, too, she said, concerns about moving from a small elementary school to a junior high with over 1,000 students, potential bullying, changing classes and ""the reality of six teachers and ... six times the homework and six times the expectations,"" she said.</p>  <p>Middle school 'not agony for all kids '</p>  <p>Here's something that Garcia and any other parent about to send off a child to middle or junior high school can find comfort in hearing: Most kids survive!</p>  <p>""I think it's important to understand that middle school is not agony for all kids,"" said psychologist Carl Pickhardt, author of ""Surviving Your Child's Adolescence."" ""For most kids, middle school is relatively fine.""</p>  <p>That said, there are no doubt big changes coming their way, Pickhardt added, including exposure to acts of social cruelty, in person and online, which they didn't see in elementary school, ""the teasing and the bullying and the exclusion and rumoring and the ganging up.""</p>  <p>READ: SOS for stressed out teens</p>  <p>Rebecca Levey, a New York mom of two whose daughters started middle school last year, said her biggest worry was social. ""And I was right to be worried,"" she added, saying the boys were surprisingly meaner than the girls.</p>  <p>""I was shocked. All you think about is mean girls but ... the boys were a thousand times worse,"" said Levey, who writes about balancing motherhood and her tech start-up on her blog Beccarama.</p>  <p>Pickhardt, who hosts a blog on Psychology Today , said one of the many challenges for parents during this transition time is balancing their child's sense of independence with their continued need for parenting.</p>  <p>Children might feel that they should be able to handle things like bullying, sexual talk and risk-taking behavior themselves now and that if they tell their parents about any of it, it means they are not able to handle their experiences, he added.</p>  <p>Parents should say, ""I really want to be there to help you sort out what you hear from other kids,"" said Pickhardt. ""I'll just give you my perception of stuff that you can add to your own thinking to figure out what you believe. ... I'd like to be there to be able to do that for you.""</p>  <p>'They still want to play (with) Barbies '</p>  <p>It's also important for parents to remember that middle school is a time when their children are ""toying with adulthood,"" but they're still kids, said Amanda Rodriguez, a former middle school teacher and host of the blog Dude Mom.</p>  <p>""Understanding that your child is having these feelings and their body is changing and they're experiencing all these new things that an older person should be experiencing but at the same time, they come home and they still want to play (with) Barbies,"" said Rodriguez, a mom of three whose oldest son is a soon-to-be seventh grader.</p>  <p>READ: The great homework debate: Too much, too little or busy work?</p>  <p>How much independence to give a child during the middle school years is another big challenge for parents, said Pickhardt. Too often, he said, parents might think they should let go completely, especially of their child's academic responsibilities, which he said could be a big mistake.</p>  <p>Schools might send the message that if the child doesn't do his or her homework, they'll get zeroes and learn from their failures, but Pickhardt said he believes most kids don't learn that. ""They learn failure, so that's why parents have to be there.""</p>  <p>That means making sure homework is done and turned in, and if the child refuses to bring homework home or turn it in, the parent can offer to accompany the child to school and hand in the homework together -- something most children would refuse.</p>  <p>""You've got to give that kind of supervisory support because this is not a permanently disaffected state, but if that state is just let go the kid can do themselves some long-lasting damage, and that's not right.

In the window was a display about mother-daughter book clubs.</p>  <p>Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon</p>  <p>Charlotte was immediately curious. ""We went in, and she really quickly said, 'Mommy, I want to do this.' And ... all the light bulbs were going off for me.""</p>  <p>Day and Charlotte, who was then 8 and in the third grade, went on to start their mother-daughter book club in 2000 with four other mothers and daughters.</p>  <p>Their experiences and the ways mother-daughter book clubs can help empower girls are the focus of Day's new book, ""Her Next Chapter: How Mother-Daughter Book Clubs Can Help Girls Navigate Malicious Media, Risky Relationships, Girl Gossip and So Much More.""</p>  <p>For six years, from the third grade up until the girls finished middle school, Day, Charlotte and the other mothers and daughters would meet monthly and tackle issues that the girls might have felt uncomfortable discussing directly with their mothers and that their moms might not have known how to bring up with them.</p>  <p>""You get these wonderful moments where it's almost like the girls forget their moms are there and they're into the discussion,"" Day said. She said that happened when they read a book that involved bullying.</p>  <p>""And the kids will be talking about the girl who was bullied, and then one of them will say, 'Well, that was me' or 'This happened to my friend.' They'll start telling a story about something that happened at school, and the moms are sort of invisible in that moment, and that lets you see something that you might not otherwise ever see or hear from your child or someone else's child.""</p>  <p>Children's Choice Book Awards: What your kids actually like to read</p>  <p>Ironically, they dealt with bullying in their very own club. One of the girls was fat-shaming another girl in the club who was overweight, and these were kids who had known each other since kindergarten and who had been together since the third grade.</p>  <p>""My biggest regret honestly, and I talk about this in the book, is that we never explicitly discussed at the beginning of forming our club what we would do if it happens, because there was just this ... assumption that we had been friends for so long that we were somehow immune, but why did we think that?</p>  <p>""Anyone's child can be the bully; anyone's child can be bullied.""</p>  <p>Day recommends that mothers who are planning to start a book club get together first to discuss issues such as how they'll handle any conflicts, the goals of the club and the comfort level with the amount of sex and violence that might be included in books, especially as the girls enter middle school.</p>  <p>At times, even in her own club, it was hard to come to agreement on books. She was the more liberal member of her club when it came to mature content, she says, because as someone who has worked in schools for 25 years, she knew that children are always more worldly than their parents think they are.</p>  <p>Mean girls: How not to raise one</p>  <p>""So I wanted my daughter to share about things and learn about things first with me so that ... I could process those things with her and answer her questions.""</p>  <p>Day believes mother-daughter book clubs may be even more important today than when she started one nearly 15 years ago.</p>  <p>""When I was raising Charlotte, we didn't have the Internet. We didn't have the cyberbullying. We did not have the digital media assault on girls in terms of body image and everything that we have right now.</p>  <p>""I have so many concerns about how adrift girls can be and how vulnerable they are to the messages they get from media about what their role is as females, and so I think having these clubs is just a way to sidestep some of that noise.""</p>  <p>Helping girls navigate what they see and hear in the media was an enormous positive to their book club experience, Day said. So was getting to know her daughter, now a graduate student at the University of Rhode Island, in a unique way.</p>  <p>The puberty ad you'll want to show all girls and boys</p>  <p>""I had a different lens on her than I ever would have had without this experience of seeing her in a group with other girls and seeing her with other female role models besides me,"" she said. ""It let us know the girls and the girls know us as human beings, just in a different way than mommies and daughters.""</p>  <p>It was also a big benefit to learn from the other mothers: to see how they modeled things, how they talked to their girls and how they handled issues.</p>  <p>""I mean, we dealt with a lot of the usual things that come up in life such as going back to work, divorce, more children, things that happen in the life of a family,"" she said.</p>  <p>They also became each other's support group. ""I think mothers can feel really isolated and intimidated. The parenting culture right now is very judgmental and confusing, all these different methods ... attachment parenting or this or that, and we were not about that stuff. ... We created our own support system for raising these girls.""</p>  <p>To those who say ""what about mother-son or father-son book clubs,"" Day says bring them on. She supports any opportunity for parents and their children to connect over books -- or movies and videos if the parents or children don't have the interest or time to read.</p>  <p>Middle school transition: Tough for teens and parents</p>  <p>She wrote about mother-daughter book clubs, she says, because that was her experience but also because she does believe there are certain issues going on now in our culture that are particularly difficult for girls.</p>  <p>""Boys have issues too, and I have concerns about boys as well, but I think for girls, when you are talking about media and marketing, the sexualization, the stereotypes about girls, the dumbing down of stuff for girls is just so concerning to me, so I don't feel I have anything to apologize for in pushing mother-daughter book clubs.""</p>  <p>No, you don't, as far as this reporter is concerned.

But apparently I'm supposed to be embarrassed about my love of Green's books.</p>  <p>Says who?</p>  <p>Says Ruth Graham, author of a recent Slate.com jeremiad that proclaims : ""Adults should feel embarrassed about reading literature written for children."" Graham goes on to assert that realistic (i.e. non-supernatural, non-dystopian) young-adult-targeted books are somehow supplanting works of literary fiction in adults' reading lives and how that's a ""shame.""</p>  <p>It's the "" should "" (Slate's italics, not mine) here that vexes me most. It implies that someone else's hierarchy of taste and personal experience takes precedent over your own, when in reality, letting go of that is one of the great spoils of achieving adulthood.</p>  <p>Let me get anecdotal here for a second.</p>  <p>In my mid-20s, when I was a good deal less assured about my own worth in the world, and rather too highly dependent upon the approval of others, I dated a man who was hampered by neither of those issues. He was six years older than me, born and bred in New York City, possessed of an English degree from a Little Ivy, and let me know in no uncertain terms that he thought my taste in art and media was lowbrow and crappy. I was harangued for my ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fixation, poo-poohed for my love of ""Gilmore Girls"" and told that my favorite book -- at the time ""The Great Gatsby"" -- was ""so high school.""</p>  <p>What should I read then, I'd ask. Something that means something, he'd say, something important. But what I neglected to ask was ""Important to whom?"" Where did my own pleasure, curiosity and opinion fit in? I'm embarrassed (yes, that word) to say that at the time, I knuckled under.</p>  <p>While my boyfriend and I found common ground with Haruki Murakami books and Guy Maddin films, I distanced myself from the words, sounds and images that connected me to the world at large, made me think and feel, and moreover, gave me pleasure. For my annual birthday movie outing, I opted for ""Le Temps retrouvé"" and tossed aside my Jennifer Weiner books to heft up ""The Golden Bowl"" instead.</p>  <p>Was I suddenly a more worthy, worldly person, with bigger, better thoughts? Not that I could tell, but I did get an awful lot quieter about admitting to people what made me happy -- and maybe a little bit judgmental about other people's tastes, too. And that makes the world (at least my world) a little smaller.</p>  <p>But that was a long time ago. I've grown up, and the fellow in question has, too. I told him I'd finished ""The Golden Bowl"" after we'd broken up -- just to impress and spite him, and he admitted to me that he never actually finished any Henry James. We're friends now, and periodically send recommendations of bands and movies and ridiculous YouTube videos to each other, not for the sake of bettering or shaming one another but simply to share something wonderful with someone who will be delighted by it.</p>  <p>A brief history of young adult literature</p>  <p>Which brings me back to John Green. I surely hadn't stopped reading in the interim years -- and in fact started writing for a living -- but did so with maybe a little more duty and less abandon than in years past. My shelves, and eventually my Kindle app, groaned under the sturdy weight of nonfiction object histories, cultural critiques and work-related memoirs and biographies that made me conversant at parties and a little less giddy about the cerebellum. And if I read any YA fiction or chick lit, I kept my mouth glued shut about it.</p>  <p>But then along came ""The Fault In Our Stars."" It had been recommended to me by smart people I trust, and I had a multi-hour plane flight, so why not?</p>  <p>It undammed me.</p>  <p>Not just with the obvious, snotty sobbing I did in seat 23A, but in the way that for the first time in ages, I wanted to announce to the world at large that I was in big, sloppy love with a book and I wasn't about to apologize to anyone for that.</p>  <p>This quirky novel about two kids in love who are battling life-threatening illness took the brains and psyches of teenagers seriously. It made me hyper-conscious of the seconds between (hopefully) hitting the tarmac safely and a treacherous cab ride on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, because they were standing in between me and the arms of my husband. It made me feel things and do things, and for the life of me, I can't understand that's inferior to knowing more things.</p>  <p>And I've read a lot of YA since then: old favorites from Bette Greene, Robert Cormier, Madeleine L'Engle and Paul Zindel, and a new canon from writers like Green, Rainbow Rowell, Lauren Oliver, Ava Dellaira and a whole host of others who deserve to be heard.</p>  <p>I read plenty of other books (yes, for ""grownups""), too, and probably even more than I used to because my hunger for good words is so keenly whet. They go down a lot more easily now that I'm not choking on all that embarrassment.</p>  <p>Books that changed your lives</p>  <p>Are you an adult who reads young adult fiction?

"283","My life as a little person","CNN.com","2014-09-12 13:24:36","2014-10-06 06:11:08","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/12/living/little-person-dwarfism-first-person/index.html","Living"," <p>The nurse exclaimed it when I finally arrived, a month late (a habit I have kept). That's how my parents found out that I was a little person, a dwarf, of short stature. They were shocked and upset, knowing that my life would be hard. My maternal grandfather told my mother, ""I don't care how tall she is, she's my first granddaughter, and she's pretty. ""</p>  <p>They didn't find out I had achondroplastic dwarfism until a few months later. ""Achondroplasia"" is a word that haunted me in my childhood. I never wanted to hear it. It wasn't who I was. I was not different.</p>  <p>According to a 2009 report by Richard M. Pauli from the Midwest Regional Bone Dysplasia Clinics, achondroplasia happens 1 in every 25,000 births. It doesn't really matter how often it happens, we happened, and we're here.</p>  <p>My brother is as big as I am small and has been my protector from day one. He made it possible for me to live whatever life I choose. My parents grew up during the civil rights movement. They and their siblings were the only black kids at their respective Catholic schools in middle America. They were treated as subpar. While they were allowed in, they weren't allowed to fully participate. They were denied equal treatment. The indignities they endured are too many to list. My parents made sure my brother and I participated in whatever we wanted.</p>  <p>My family cares for me and at the same time has never shielded me from the world. That's how they raised me. I am Cara. Expectations are not lowered. We can talk about it whenever I need to, but I have not been allowed to hide.</p>  <p>Attack of the 4'2"" chef</p>  <p>Even so, living as a little person is like being the main attraction at the circus every day of my life. Going grocery shopping, getting tampons at the drugstore -- it's like being a celebrity, and the whole world is my paparazzi. The tag line of my blog, Infamously Short , is ""celebrity without fame or money,"" and that's pretty accurate.</p>  <p>I don't believe anonymity is achievable for me. That can make a person a little crazy. And angry.</p>  <p>When I was a child, I used to walk into public places and scan the room to figure out who would be the first to say something. Inevitably, they did. Most of the time it was ""Isn't she cute?"" But sometimes it was more cruel. Deeper. Darker.</p>  <p>They hold their hands over their mouths and laugh, trying to look away but also alert their friends. They whisper, ""There's a midget.""</p>  <p>When I make eye contact, they look away and try to hold in their laughter. I can read lips. It's from a lifetime of watching people mouth ""midget."" There are times when they don't even pretend to hide their ridicule. Walking in a mall, I pass a store. Someone spots me and then brings their whole family to stand in the store window to laugh and jeer.</p>  <p>My existence is a joke to them. When these people refer to little people, they often say, ""Look at it.""</p>  <p>Little people, big top</p>  <p>To them, I am not even human. I'm a different species. It's even used in a clinical capacity. In medical journals, the language is something like ""this male dwarf."" Do they say ""this male autistic"" or ""this female cerebral palsy""? The answer is no, it's always ""this person"" with ""fill in the condition.""</p>  <p>When I was a child, I used to internalize the torment. Outwardly, I was stoic. I pretended it wasn't happening. Inside, I was crying and wishing I was someone else. It shaped how I felt about myself. I was often the target of bullies in school and felt prejudice from some of my teachers. They never outwardly said anything, but they made it difficult to participate in activities. I also had some wonderful teachers who cheered me on, even when I was being lazy.</p>  <p>I played basketball in grade school, not very well, but I tried. The coach, Mr. Sweeney, worked out plays so that I could score. I took dance, something to which I was much more suited. Mrs. Wren required I work as hard or harder as the other girls. She showed me how to be graceful in a body that is typically not regarded as graceful.</p>  <p>I have always been a bit of a drifter searching for a new adventure. When I was 12, I went to India, and it changed my life. I was gone almost a month and was at least three travel days away from my parents. I was scared, exhilarated and free. That trip set the tone for my life.</p>  <p>From the age of 18 to 27, I lived in six cities and moved eight times. During that time, I got three degrees: in political science, theater and photography. I couldn't decide what I wanted to be when I grew up -- or, more accurately, I had a hard time figuring out what the world would allow me to be. When I moved to New York to start work as a photographer, I finally had to face why I had been running: I am a little person.</p>  <p>Manila's little people seek their own community</p>  <p>Coming to terms with being a little person has been a long process, complicated by the world's prejudice. I don't wake up every morning and think ""Oh, woe is me, I am a little person."" I wake up and get on with my day. (My first thought is usually ""Oh, no, I am late again."") I fly out of the house in whatever outfit I have cobbled together, grab breakfast at the bodega and check my email while rushing to the subway. As each moment passes, I calculate how many minutes I am going to be late.</p>  <p>But, like a kick in the chest, I am startled, because someone interrupts my morning routine by pointing, laughing or taking a picture. I am no longer just Cara, the free-spirited comedian who has trouble getting to work on time. I am the little person who deserves ridicule. I'm late to work, running with a body that doesn't have the greatest leg span, praying that the A train is working, and now I have to interact with someone who thinks my mere existence on this planet is a joke. It's a fantastic way to start a day.</p>  <p>Within the past 10 years, I have stopped internalizing my anger and started directing it outward, where it belongs. Why should I put up with the taunting, the picture-taking, the inappropriate sexual propositions on a daily basis just because I am different externally? The answer is: I shouldn't.</p>  <p>I have different levels of response to people's reactions.</p>  <p>If someone laughs, I ask, ""What's funny?"" Most of the time people say, ""Nothing, nothing,"" and then run off in embarrassment.</p>  <p>If people use the word ""midget,"" I say, ""It's called dwarfism. Don't use that word.""</p>  <p>Then there are the sexual deviants. Men approach me in the street and start conversations with ""I want to try it. Sex with you would be different.""</p>  <p>I yell back, ""I am not a sampler platter, no."" They respond with an indignant ""I just want to try it. It would be fun. You don't have to get nasty.""</p>  <p>That's what I hear whenever I defend myself. Apparently, I am supposed to take it. I am supposed to suck it up.</p>  <p>One of my friends says, ""Cara is always trying to prove she's normal."" I am normal. I have the same thoughts, feelings and desires. The world treats me as if there is something wrong with me. It took me a while not to trust the world's opinion.</p>  <p></p> "
"284","What depression feels like","CNN.com","2014-08-20 12:45:41","2014-10-06 06:11:11","http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/22/living/going-public-with-depression/index.html","Living"," <p>I sink into unconsciousness, mumbling over and over again, ""I need help... I need help... I need help."" I'm too quiet. No one hears.</p>  <p>Several months, countless medical tests and many slept-through school days later, a diagnosis is dispensed, along with a bottle of thick, chalky pills. There is palpable relief from my physician and parents; nothing is physically wrong with me (thank God, not the cancer they've quietly feared) -- likely just a bout of depression. While it helps a little to have a name for the sensation, I'm less enthralled with the diagnosis, because I know it will return. While this is the first time it's manifested heavily enough for anyone else to see it, I've been slipping in and out of this dull gray sweater for as long as I can remember.</p>  <p>What doesn't help at the time are the pills: clunky mid-1980s tricyclic antidepressants that seize up my bowels, cause my tongue to click from lack of moisture, and upon my return to school cause me to nearly pitch over a third-story railing from dizziness. I flush the rest and, mercifully, no one bothers me about it.</p>  <p>If they do, I probably don't even notice; my brain is too occupied, thrumming with guilt, stupidity and embarrassment. Nothing is physically wrong. It's all in your head. This ache, this low, this sickness, this sadness -- they are of your making and there is no cure.</p>  <p>Now, 25 years later, I've lost too much time and too many people to feel any shame about the way my psyche is built. How from time to time, for no good reason, it drops a thick, dark jar over me to block out air and love and light, and keeps me at arm's length from the people I love most.</p>  <p>The pain and ferocity of the bouts have never eased, but I've lived in my body long enough to know that while I'll never ""snap out of it,"" at some point the glass will crack and I'll be free to walk about in the world again. It happens every time, and I have developed a few tricks to remind myself of that as best I can when I'm buried deepest.</p>  <p>The thing that's always saved me has been regular sessions with an excellent therapist and solidarity with other people battling the same gray monster (medication worked for me for a little while -- I take nothing now, but it's a lifesaver and a necessity for some). When I was diagnosed, it was not in an era of Depression Pride parades on the main street of my small Kentucky town. In 1987, less than one person in 100 was being treated for depression. That had doubled in 1997, and by 2007, the number had increased to slightly less than three.</p>  <p>My friend Dave was part of that tally. We met in our freshman year of college, and he was one of the loudest, funniest, most exuberant humans I'd ever met -- and the most deeply depressed. Not that anyone outside our intimate circle knew; like many of us who live with the condition, he wore a brighter self in public to distract from the darkness that settled over him behind closed doors. Most people don't see depression in others, and that's by design. We depressives simply spirit ourselves away when we've dimmed so as not to stain those who live in the sun.</p>  <p>Dave saw it in me, though, and I in him; and for the first time in my life, I felt somewhat normal. Like I didn't have to tap dance, sparkle and shine to distract from the fact that I was broken. I could just be me, and that wasn't a half-bad thing in his eyes. I began to tell more people as plainly as I did other facts of my being -- I was born in New Jersey, my real hair color under all this pink dye is very dark brown, and I've suffered from depression as long as I can remember. I'm Kat -- nice to know you.</p>  <p>Dave never made it that far. His cracks were too deep and dark, and he poured so much vodka down into them to dilute the pain. A year after graduation, in the late summer of 1995, I was unsurprised but thoroughly gutted when I got the call -- Dave had tidied his apartment, neatly laid out a note, his accounts and bills, next to checks from his balanced checkbook, and stepped into a closet with a belt.</p>  <p>I see Dave in little flashes all the time, still -- hear his braying OHMYGAAWWWDD laugh around a corner and see his handsome gap-toothed smile in a crowd. I want to smack him full across the face for giving up and leaving us all, and I want to drag him to a computer and sit him down: Look -- we're not alone.</p>  <p>Dave was the first person I ever knew with Internet access. Among a million other things I wish he'd lived to see is the community of souls online, generously baring and sharing their depression struggles with strangers. There's no substitute for quality therapy (in whatever flavor you take it) or medication (if that's your cup of homeopathic tea), but by God, it's hard to get there.</p>  <p>To see your feelings echoed and normalized in essays like comedian Rob Delaney's much-forwarded "" On Depression and Getting Help ""; author Stephen Fry's legendary letter to a fan, ""It will be sunny one day ""; the ongoing, public struggles of widely read bloggers and authors Dooce and The Bloggess ; and guests of the no-edges-blunted WTF Podcast from comedian Marc Maron -- all highly successful and public people -- is to dare to let a crack of blue sky into the basement where you've been tucked away. I can barely imagine what it would have meant to my 14-year-old self to read Delaney's words:</p>  <p>""The sole reason I've written this is so that someone who is depressed or knows someone who is depressed might see it. ... But after having been through depression and having had the wonderful good fortune to help a couple of people who've been through it, I will say that as hard as it is, IT CAN BE SURVIVED. And after the stabilization process, which can be and often is f**king terrifying, a HAPPY PRODUCTIVE LIFE is possible and statistically likely. Get help. Don't think. Get help.""</p>  <p>Or Fry's:</p>  <p>""Here are some obvious things about the weather :
It's real .
You can't change it by wishing it away. If it's dark and rainy it really is dark and rainy and you can't alter it. It might be dark and rainy for two weeks in a row .
BU T
It will be sunny one day .
It isn't under one's control as to when the sun comes out, but come out it will. One day.</p>  <p>It really is the same with one's moods, I think. The wrong approach is to believe that they are illusions. They are real. Depression, anxiety, listlessness -- these are as real as the weather -- AND EQUALLY NOT UNDER ONE'S CONTROL. Not one's fault.</p>  <p>BUT</p>  <p>They will pass: they really will.""</p>  <p>Dave will never see those words, or these, but someone will -- including the 14-year-old me who still sometimes rides shotgun as I'm driving through a storm. I show her these words, these essays, these poems, these podcasts beamed out by the other souls who glitter out in the darkness.

"285","Women face baldness head on","CNN.com","2014-05-02 15:50:35","2014-10-06 06:11:20","http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/29/living/women-hair-loss-alopecia-relate/index.html","Living"," <p>On her prom night, Jennifer DeFreece was harried by one simple detail: ""I just wanted eyebrows for my prom pictures.""</p>  <p>When she was just a baby, DeFreece was diagnosed with alopecia totalis, an autoimmune disease that results in the total loss of scalp hair. By her 1st birthday, she'd lost all of her hair.</p>  <p>""I was like Charlie Brown,"" says DeFreece, now 33 and living in Northridge, California.</p>  <p>Alopecia is nondiscriminatory. It can occur in men and women at any age and is a strictly physical disease, but sufferers say it's also a disease of the spirit, exacting a devastating emotional toll in this world of silky shampoo commercials and Rapunzel fairy tales.</p>  <p>For those who experience it, particularly women who often self-identify with the color and style of their locks, it's about learning to manage the disease and not be defined by it. They choose a way to self-present: wig, no wig, clean shaven or a little of each.</p>  <p>DeFreece ventured into wearing wigs in kindergarten as the childish innocence of her peers grew more inquisitive and uncensored. She continued to do so throughout junior high. At the time, the wigs available were ""very obvious,"" she says. Before then, being bald never seemed taboo; it was her normal.</p>  <p>Then came sleepover age: A girl insisted DeFreece put a housecoat over the pillow where she would rest her head. To that girl, baldness was gross. In those years, DeFreece says she became more shy and hyperaware about what made her different.</p>  <p>""I hated it. I would wish that my hair would grow back,"" DeFreece says.</p>  <p>In high school, when she realized people might make fun of her anyway, she took one a giant leap toward self-awareness: She decided to ditch the hairpiece and embrace the beauty of bald.</p>  <p>Brave middle schooler tells peers she's bald</p>  <p>""I thought, 'Let them make fun of somebody with a medical condition, let's see what happens,' "" she says. The response was mature: People backed off and even stood up for her.</p>  <p>Learning to value yourself and not your hair</p>  <p>According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases , a big part of the coping process is about ""learning to value yourself for who you are, not for how much hair you have or don't have.""</p>  <p>Sue McHale is a psychology lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University in England, and has extensively researched the psychological toll of the disease, including co-authoring the book, ""Coping with Alopecia.""</p>  <p>""Baldness, for whatever reason, is associated firstly with aging and secondly with illness,"" McHale said in an e-mail. ""So society is automatically shocked or fearful of this.""</p>  <p>McHale's co-researcher and husband, Nigel Hunt, has alopecia universalis, the rarest form of the disease, one that results in total loss of body hair. (The most common form of alopecia is alopecia areata, which causes the hair to fall out in patches.)</p>  <p>When McHale found there was hardly any psychological research done on the disease, they dug in.</p>  <p>""It opened up a floodgate of responses and many said that they felt no one had been listening to them for years,"" she says. It was no longer just a physical diagnosis.</p>  <p>She says their research found that there was a perception from both sexes that it was worse for women; that it seemed more acceptable for men to appear bald. However, both men and women with alopecia aren't opting to go bald -- ""it is forced upon them, so in that way, they respond to it very much in the same way,"" she says.</p>  <p>Those who are balding or are born with a hairless pate can experience embarrassment, hopelessness, hastiness for a ""quick fix,"" and, if a wig wearer, the fear that others might find out that their hair actually isn't their own.</p>  <p>She found a man who didn't care about hair</p>  <p>For Lauren Crawford, 29, that feeling came to a head on a first date in high school. After a few previous dates didn't handle her diagnosis so well, she decided to lay it all out on the table that very first night, warning him that she had something to confess.</p>  <p>""'If you want to walk out the door, that's OK,'"" she remembers saying.</p>  <p>""Oh thank God,"" her date responded. ""That's it?!""</p>  <p>Crawford, of Macomb, Michigan, has been married to the man to whom she made that first-date confession for five years.</p>  <p>Crawford, like DeFreece, received a diagnosis early on in life -- at 3 -- but didn't see more serious aspects of the disease, especially psychologically, until her senior year in high school.</p>  <p>""I didn't think anything of it,"" she says. Seeing a bald woman wasn't out of her realm of experience; her grandmother was going through chemotherapy at the same time.</p>  <p>As her hairline changed rapidly in her teen years, she sought solace in scrunchies and scarves. When those no longer did the job, she and her mom went wig shopping.</p>  <p>Her friends at the time started to call her ""Baldy"" and tugged at her hair. She admits feeling like she would never get married and never have kids. Now, she has both -- and an unforeseen career as a hairdresser.</p>  <p>""I always had a creative eye for hair; I was always creative in hiding my bald spots,"" says Crawford, who wears a wig every day, calling it ""an accessory.""</p>  <p>For other women, Crawford has become an unlikely ally. She recounts how a woman came in heartbroken as the effects of chemotherapy laid her scalp bare. Crawford took her wig off and showed her true self; they wept together and talked through the change.</p>  <p>""It's just hair,"" she remembers saying.</p>  <p>'For me to walk out bald, it's so hard'</p>  <p>Vanessa McWilliams, 30, of Calgary is in a more transitional period -- often forgoing the wigs that were her safety blankets for more than 20 years.</p>  <p>""I love who I am, but at the same time, for me to walk out bald, it's so hard because there's so much trauma growing up,"" she says, recalling jabs such as ""baldy"" throughout her teenage years.</p>  <p>With the new hairless territory, she says she had to adapt to the occasional awkward moment of a stranger approaching her because they think she's sick.</p>  <p>""You're healthy! There's nothing wrong with you, but society still has to look at you. It's so hard to hear there's nothing wrong with you. The mentality of it is still a mental battle. It's really tricky,"" she says.</p>  <p>Unlike DeFreece and Crawford, who were too young at the time of their diagnosis to comprehend the condition, McWilliams didn't receive her diagnosis until adolescence.</p>  <p>""From the date that I found my first bald spot (at age 9) until I was 17, I had a really big hatred for the word 'alopecia' and everything that it put me through,"" she says.</p>  <p>McWilliams now operates Confident Curls , a mobile wig boutique specifically geared toward women who are coping with hair loss.</p>  <p>Her epiphany: She's lived with this every single day and knows first-hand what people in the same situation need.</p>  <p>""I wish at 9 years old I had known that it was OK. It's so simple. ... Everyone is dealt something they have to struggle with,"" McWilliams says. ""Now, I know it isn't the worst thing that could happen to me.""</p>  <p>But there's always work to do.</p>  <p>DeFreece calls those less-than-pretty-feeling days, as all people have, ""an alopecia day."" There are also upsides: ""People will always remember you, and you can use that as an advantage,"" she says.</p>  <p>She has met a network of women through organizations such as the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (DeFreece attends its annual conference every year) and social media, which has helped her adjust.</p>  <p>When they get together, their lack of hair isn't the glaring beacon it is to others.</p>  <p>""I'm not just Jennifer the bald girl. I'm Jennifer the marketing major. I'm Jennifer from California,"" DeFreece says.</p> "

Last year, Forbes magazine said tattoos were becoming ""increasingly unproblematic across the board,"" even in the workplace.</p>  <p>But the workplace doesn't seem to be ready for tattoos in certain areas -- mainly the face, head and neck.</p>  <p>In 2011, 31% of employers nationwide told job website Career Builder that having a visible tattoo would hinder a candidate's likelihood of being promoted.</p>  <p>Earlier this year, Army Regulation 670-1 enforced new rules prohibiting soldiers from displaying tattoos on the head, face, neck, wrists, hands and fingers.</p>  <p>""Tattoos are getting more and more accepted,"" said Alivia Foley, a 24-year old tattoo artist who has been inking clients full-time for six years in Seattle. ""But we're not there yet.""</p>  <p>""People will start treating you differently once you become a heavily tattooed person,"" said Foley, who has head and neck tattoos.</p>  <p>Potential employers, law enforcement and even landlords can look askance at facial tats, in her experience.</p>  <p>""I just don't think they're for everybody,"" she said.</p>  <p>The accepted few</p>  <p>Of course when Foley says highly visible tattoos are not for everybody, she means everybody who wants a professional job.</p>  <p>For years American society has openly accepted celebrities who choose to sport highly visible tattoos.</p>  <p>Boxer Mike Tyson, who had his face tattooed with a tribal symbol in 2003, was an early adopter of the look. Rapper Gucci Mane said he inked an ice cream cone on his cheek because he's ""cool as ice"" and top-selling rap artist Lil Wayne has teardrops and ""Fear God"" on his eyelids.</p>  <p>Neck tattoos can be seen on anyone from urban youths to international arbiters of style. Rihanna and David and Victoria Beckham each have them.</p>  <p>Even Oscar winner Jamie Foxx appears to have gotten a tribal symbol permanently drawn on the back of his head.</p>  <p>""Tattooing has gone from being counterculture to being something everyone is doing,"" Foley said. ""But societal repercussions are still there, especially with highly visible tattoos on the face, neck or hands.""</p>  <p>This is certainly true with nonfamous men and women.</p>  <p>Canadian rapper Drake was irate when a young fan followed the instructions from his song, ""Free Spirit,"" and got a tattoo of his name on her forehead.</p>  <p>And take Jeremy Meeks, the ""Hot Felon"" who boasts a Facebook fan page with more than 228,000 likes, but has had his teardrop tattoo PhotoShopped out of some Internet memes.</p>  <p>The teardrop, often associated with gang culture and violence, does not fit the high-fashion aesthetic of his dreamy blue eyes. Perhaps our culture is more willing to overlook a criminal history than a conspicuous blotch of ink.</p>  <p>Anyone considering a facial tattoo should be warned about the repercussions, said Foley, the Seattle tattooist.</p>  <p>""If a tattoo artist is not giving a lecture on a face tattoo, they're not doing their job.""</p>  <p>Foley will ink clients' faces only if they are already heavily tattooed -- and even then she will meet with them beforehand to ensure they have a clear understanding of the societal risks.</p>  <p>But those who want them can still get face, head and neck tattoos without proper consultation and warning.

""But now you can buy kits off of Ebay and call yourself a tattoo artist without any apprenticeship or traditional training.""</p>  <p>'I feel more like myself '</p>  <p>No amount of warning deterred Vin Los.</p>  <p>Los, a 24-year-old aspiring fashion model, spent years getting rejected from agencies because of his diminutive height. Finally, he says, after a New York modeling agency told him he'd never get hired, he decided to make some changes to his appearance.</p>  <p>Drastic changes.</p>  <p>Los has more than 30 phrases tattooed on his body, including 12 across his face. They include words like fame, play, iconic face, sex, lick, Tokyo, and ""the most famous.""</p>  <p>He estimated that his tattoo plans were initially rejected by eight artists.</p>  <p>""I know I'm intense and I live my life to the fullest,"" he said. ""But now I don't have to tell people 'this is who I am or these are my dreams.'""</p>  <p>""Now they can read it and they can see it.""</p>  <p>Sounds like Kat Von D.</p>  <p>Los thrives on the media attention he receives but still has not completed his dream of signing to a modeling agency.

""They have a strong sense of identity and they have no intention of hiding. They are not scared of public opinion and would love to let others know what they believe in.""</p>  <p>However, Mantell, who wrote an article titled "" The Psychology of Tattoos "" for San Diego Magazine, said this boldness does not necessary translate into comfort with one's self, especially when it comes to highly visible tattoos.</p>  <p>""Tattoos on the upper body in a spot that's not typically covered says someone doesn't care what other people think -- but don't mistake that for a healthy sense of individuality,"" he said.</p>  <p>""It's more likely a sign of rebelliousness.""</p>  <p>Mantell and Foley urged individuals to think before they ink highly visible tattoos on the face, head, neck and hands, again citing mainstream exclusion.</p>  <p>But Los said he's never felt more like himself.</p>  <p>""For 10 months, I was wearing makeup to hide the tattoos and little by little I began to show more,"" he said. ""I am an artist and have always had the need to express myself, now I'm just doing that on my skin.""</p>  <p>Los said he is very happy with his decision and loves the way he looks.</p>  <p>He never felt a part of society, and now he has the face to match.</p>  <p>Do facial tattoos change your opinion of a person?

"287","What women couldn't do in the 60s","CNN.com","2014-08-22 15:26:25","2014-10-06 06:11:30","http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/07/living/sixties-women-5-things/index.html","Living"," <p>It was not so long ago that this was the reality for women. If you're 45 or older, you were born into this world.</p>  <p>When President John F. Kennedy established the Commission on the Status of Women in 1961, he appointed Eleanor Roosevelt as chairwoman. In a televised 1962 discussion with Roosevelt , Kennedy stated, ""We want to be sure that women are used as effectively as they can to provide a better life for our people, in addition to meeting their primary responsibility, which is in the home.""</p>  <p>This was a mixed message, effectively telling women, ""Go! Learn! Flourish! Do! ... but also, have babies and put your husband's needs before your own.""</p>  <p>But you can thank the nation's real-life Peggy Olsons for beginning to roar at this time. Have a look back at five surprising things women could not do in the 1960s:</p>  <p>1. Get a credit card: In the 1960s, a bank could refuse to issue a credit card to an unmarried woman; even if she was married, her husband was required to cosign. As recently as the 1970s, credit cards in many cases were issued with only a husband's signature. It was not until the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 that it became illegal to refuse a credit card to a woman based on her gender.</p>  <p>2. Serve on a jury: It varied by state (Utah deemed women fit for jury duty way back in 1879), but the main reason women were kept out of jury pools was that they were considered the center of the home, which was their primary responsibility as caregivers. They were also thought to be too fragile to hear the grisly details of crimes and too sympathetic by nature to be able to remain objective about those accused of offenses. In 1961, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a Florida law that exempted women from serving on juries. It wasn't until 1973 that women could serve on juries in all 50 states.</p>  <p>Longing for the carefree parenting style of yesterday?</p>  <p>3. Go on the birth control pill: Issues like reproductive freedom and a woman's right to decide when and whether to have children were only just beginning to be openly discussed in the 1960s. In 1957, the FDA approved of the birth control pill but only for ""severe menstrual distress."" In 1960, the pill was approved for use as a contraceptive. Even so, the pill was illegal in some states and could be prescribed only to married women for purposes of family planning, and not all pharmacies stocked it. Some of those opposed said oral contraceptives were immoral, promoted prostitution and were tantamount to abortion. It wasn't until several years later that birth control was approved for use by all women, regardless of marital status. In short, birth control meant a woman could complete her education, enter the work force and plan her own life.</p>  <p>What 'The Pill' did</p>  <p>4. Get an Ivy League education:</p>  <p>Yale and Princeton didn't accept female students until 1969. Harvard didn't admit women until 1977 (when it merged with the all-female Radcliffe College). With the exception of the University of Pennsylvania, which began accepting women on a case-by-case basis in 1876, and Cornell, which admitted its first female student in 1870 (also offering admission under special circumstances), women couldn't attend Ivy League schools until 1969 at the earliest. Brown (which merged with women's college Pembroke), Dartmouth and Columbia did not offer admission to women until 1971, 1972 and 1981, respectively. Other case-specific instances allowed some women to take certain classes at Ivy League institutions (such as Barnard women taking classes at Columbia), but by and large, women in the '60s who harbored Ivy League dreams had to put them on hold.</p>  <p>5. Experience equality in the workplace: Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women produced a report in 1963 that revealed, among other things, that women earned 59 cents for every dollar that men earned and were kept out of the more lucrative professional positions. When the 1964 Civil Rights Act was going through Congress, an amendment made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender as well as race. When the amendment was not taken seriously regarding women in the workplace, the National Organization of Women was founded to enforce full equality for women in truly equal partnership with men.</p>  <p>For example, NOW challenged several of the now-defunct airline Pan Am's rules, including the following: Stewardesses had to meet a certain height requirement, maintain a set weight, resign if they got married, maintain soft hands and face mandatory retirement at age 32. That all ended when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibited such instances of discrimination.</p>  <p>It wasn't just NOW fighting for women's rights.</p>  <p>When journalist and activist Gloria Steinem went undercover as a Playboy Bunny one year before the Civil Rights Act, she exposed the exploitative environment for women at the Playboy Club. Steinem reported their wages and detailed the sexual demands of the male clientele. When Steinem's expose was published, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner changed the working conditions of those women for the better.</p>  <p>BONUS: Talk openly about sex: Helen Gurley Brown's ""Sex and the Single Girl"" presented the notion that it was OK -- even enjoyable -- for a woman to live on her own, have her own money, have sexual relationships before marriage or even -- wait for it -- never marry at all!</p>  <p>It wasn't until publication of Betty Friedan's ""The Feminine Mystique"" that women's dissatisfaction with life and frustration over lack of opportunities came to light.</p>  <p>""A woman today has been made to feel freakish and alone and guilty if, simply, she wants to be more than her husband's wife,"" said Friedan.</p>  <p>Today, far fewer people give credence to the notion of a woman existing for the sole purpose of being the husband's helpmate.</p>  <p>Just this week, sales soared when LEGO released a playset featuring three female scientists.</p> "

I couldn't figure out if this was a pickup line, a display of respect, or just an in-your-face way of saying you're too old to be here.</p>  <p>Now technically, at 43 , I could have been a grandmother. But I wasn't even a mother, and it was still a shock.</p>  <p>I tried to grab the guy's T-shirt as he was walking past me, but the fabric pulled out of my hands. I stepped outside to take a breath and forget what happened, but couldn't shake the anger.</p>  <p>I went back in and obsessively surveyed the club until I locked in on my target. He was talking to two pretty blondes. I boldly walked up and said ""Hey! It's grandmaaaa!!""</p>  <p>I was trying to disarm them with humor before my verbal assault.</p>  <p>""Why did you call me grandma?""</p>  <p>""Sorry. I'm drunk and acting like an asshole, I guess."" I continued to pepper him with questions, anything to provoke a real answer.</p>  <p>I guess I wanted to hear ""because you look old."" Finally he asked me, somewhat menacingly, ""Are we done here?""</p>  <p>That's when I snapped out of my diatribe, realizing he was well-built and over 6 feet tall. He'd also mentioned he was an Iraq war Veteran. It's possible that this may not have ended well.</p>  <p>Despite feeling like a kid most of my life, I began to see how the guy at the club saw me: as middle-aged.</p>  <p>Aging stylishly: online and in the streets</p>  <p>The funny thing is, I don't feel ""old"" when I go to dance clubs. I have always enjoyed live music: the feeling of the bass drum through my body, seeing the guitarists' faces distort as they play and the singers inspiring the crowd to feel their lyrics.</p>  <p>Plus, being at one with a crowd feels incredible: you just can't get that on an MP3 player.</p>  <p>Most generation X'ers and baby boomer couples are apparently choosing to spend their money attending concerts at large, impersonal arenas . Bon Jovi was the top grossing concert last year, and Bruce Springsteen and The Rolling Stones were in the top 10. I imagine many of my peers attended these concerts.</p>  <p>I suppose there's safety in numbers, but I can't stand watching live music with my binoculars, just to see tiny, flea-like figures jumping on stage.</p>  <p>I rarely see other 40-somethings rocking out at small clubs.</p>  <p>Does that mean I should throw in the towel and find a more ""age-appropriate"" place to listen to music? Perhaps those sophisticated jazz dining establishments or a blues club?</p>  <p>I don't like the blues so much.</p>  <p>For months after the grandma insult, I refused to go out. I withdrew to my couch, draped in the comforting warmth of my Boston terriers. My rock 'n' roll-loving companion was kind enough to stay by my side weekend after weekend.</p>  <p>Then, one night, I finally had the nerve to venture out again.</p>  <p>My boyfriend and I rolled up to an Atlanta rock club. Outside, hipsters were barbecuing: a kind of Southern soul fest for white people.</p>  <p>A large, young bodybuilder type with a tree-trunk-sized chest greeted us at the cash register. He delicately placed the ""21 and up"" band around my wrist.</p>  <p>I walked into the dark underground cavern, my irises adjusting to the low light.</p>  <p>Twenty-year-olds were dressed like it was 1985, and long-haired rockers were wearing ripped jeans and T-shirts with '80s band names.</p>  <p>Was I beamed back to my high school years? Was this retro night for 40-year-olds?</p>  <p>No. These were millennials enjoying the hard-driving Led Zeppelin-inspired band just like me. I was just an OH -- an original hipster, who had enjoyed it the first time it was cool.</p>  <p>One young man stood next to me throwing his fabulous head of hair back and forth to the beat as we stood against the stage. He didn't treat me with any particular respect or say ""excuse me ma'am"" when his Pert-smelling mane lightly lashed my forehead throughout the night.</p>  <p>I observed young guys with ZZ Top beards and lumberjack shirts. Standing nearby were nerdy girls with glasses wearing flower-patterned dresses.</p>  <p>I dropped my self-consciousness and enjoyed the scene. I felt invigorated hanging out with this interesting mix of retro and modern youths.</p>  <p>Why should I let one grandma comment spoil my life?</p>  <p>The thing is, we 40-something gen Xers aren't the first to go through what it feels like to see another generation take over the dance floor, or the office space.</p>  <p>And we've all got to lose our self-consciousness, and just try to enjoy the ride.</p> "

Her mother and aunt had just offered to pay for her to have weight-loss surgery. But Corn knew the price tag was hefty: around $15,000.</p>  <p>""I told them no,"" said Corn, then 39, recalling the exact moment. ""I felt like I was not worth that.""</p>  <p>Her mom, Jean Corn, said the two older women knew something had to be done since diabetes runs in the family.</p>  <p>""We were just desperate,"" Jean Corn said. ""We (also) knew her heart wasn't going to be able to carry this weight forever.""</p>  <p>Corn's rejection of the offer devastated her family. But Corn had made up her mind to take matters into her own hands to lose the weight.</p>  <p>""If I was going to do this, I (was) going to do it the right way. I (was) going to do it the healthy way, and I (was) not going to rely on somebody else,"" she said.</p>  <p>In denial</p>  <p>Corn's weight problem had begun in high school in Woodstock, Georgia. She played sports, which helped her feel like she hid some of the weight, but she said she ate everything in sight.</p>  <p>""There were a lot of self-esteem issues growing up, which of course only added fuel to the fire to make it worse,"" she said.</p>  <p>She wouldn't address her weight with anybody. She got into fights with her mom about it; at one point, she told her mom never to mention it again. She avoided shopping, scales and mirrors.</p>  <p>""As long as I didn't see it, it wasn't true,"" she said.</p>  <p>In 2011, she realized she couldn't walk from her front door to her mailbox, a distance of 30 feet.</p>  <p>""I'd get to the mailbox sounding like I smoked 12 packs a day,"" she said, recalling how she complained about pain in her knees, back and feet. ""It was ridiculous.""</p>  <p>She thought about joining Weight Watchers again.</p>  <p>In 2008, Corn had tried the program, an attempt that lasted six months. She had also failed at other diets -- Nutrisystem, the South Beach Diet and Sugar Busters among them.</p>  <p>But this time, her resolve to get healthy was strong.</p>  <p>'A snowball effect '</p>  <p>Corn joined Weight Watchers shortly after the talk with her mom and aunt. This time around, her mind-set was different. She had made a commitment to herself to go to the meetings, pay attention and adhere to the plan. She had heard the plan would work if she followed it precisely.</p>  <p>Shortly after joining the program, Corn saw something at the doctor's office that would end up changing her life.</p>  <p>She went to see the doctor about her foot hurting. A note written on her chart classified her as morbidly obese. Corn was not even sure what the term meant.</p>  <p>""He told me it was because I was heavy and offered me tips on what to do for my foot but not about how to lose weight,"" she said.</p>  <p>Corn persevered. She attended her weekly Saturday morning meetings without the dread she had in her 2008 attempt. Instead of focusing on her goal of losing 150 pounds, the Bradenton, Florida, resident attempted to achieve smaller goals like 5, 10 and 25 pounds.</p>  <p>The first six months of her weight-loss journey, Corn focused strictly on her diet. After she had lost about 40 pounds, she started walking the neighborhood in addition to using her treadmill at home.</p>  <p>""It was kind of like a snowball effect,"" she said. ""I was losing more weight, which caused me to exercise more.""</p>  <p>Corn also slowly overhauled her diet.</p>  <p>""Before I knew it, I was not eating as much food as I used to,"" she said. ""It was a slow process, so my body had time to adjust to less food.""</p>  <p>Her daily diet before had been filled with fast food, fried chicken and little vegetables. Now it's all about high-protein and high-fiber foods, salads and healthy snacks.</p>  <p>And, of course, lots of water throughout the day.</p>  <p>""I do allow myself a piece of chocolate here and there, some ice cream here and there, as long as I pre-arrange for it in my mind,"" she said. ""I would feel deprived if I couldn't have those, and then that's usually when I go completely off the rails.""</p>  <p>One step at a time</p>  <p>Corn hit her goal weight of 163 pounds in March. Now, almost three years after the start of her journey, Corn weighs 161 pounds. She struggles every day, keeping healthy snacks around her at all times.</p>  <p>She blogged about her weight-loss journey, which she refers to as her ""road trip.""</p>  <p>""To me, it's not about being skinny, it's about being healthy,"" she said.</p>  <p>Corn has a message for others facing their own weight problems.</p>  <p>""First, you don't have to have a movie-star budget to do this,"" she said. ""It won't be easy, but it's your life you're dealing with, and there's nothing more precious on this earth than your own life.""</p>  <p>An avid power walker, Corn walks five miles a day. Her goal is to walk a half-marathon in Sarasota, Florida, in March.</p>  <p>Her self-confidence has also increased as a result of the ""new"" her.</p>  <p>""I'm still kind of shy, but I'm not afraid to walk up to somebody and talk to them, as opposed to standing back and waiting for them to come talk to me,"" she said.</p>  <p>And her mother couldn't be prouder.</p>  <p>""This was a person (who), if I would have paid her $1,000 to step on a treadmill, she wouldn't have done it,"" Jean Corn said. ""This is a person (who) doesn't have a personal trainer, (who) doesn't have a chef, (who) doesn't have makeup artists.

That figure proves even the healthiest can come down with the flu, says Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.</p>  <p>""Last year was an unfortunate reminder that no one is exempt from flu's most severe consequences,"" Schaffner said Thursday at the National Press Club in Washington.</p>  <p>The CDC's recommendations about the flu vaccine are similar to last year's, but there are a few updates.</p>  <p>If it's available, children between 2 and 8 should get the live attenuated influenza vaccine , commonly known as FluMist, instead of the flu shot, the CDC says. The nasal spray flu vaccine includes four influenza virus strains, and seems to be the best protection for this age group for the 2014-2015 flu season.</p>  <p>Because it is a live vaccine, the nasal spray is not recommended for women who are, or think they may be, pregnant, and is only approved for people up to age 49.</p>  <p>For those at least 65, the federal health agency says a one-two-three punch is the best way to stay healthy all year long. The CDC recommends this age group be administered a high-dose flu shot , which gives stronger immune response and a greater protection against the flu.</p>  <p>It also recommends that those over 65 be given a two-dose series of pneumococcal vaccines -- the new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, followed by the traditional pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine about six months later.</p>  <p>One more reminder: The flu can be a deadly illness, so all pregnant women should get the flu shot. The flu shot can be given in any trimester, but the sooner a new mom is vaccinated, the better for the baby.</p>  <p>A flu shot will not protect you from Enterovirus D68 , said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Although both are respiratory illnesses, they are totally different viruses. They could infect one individual at the same time; it's rare, but it could happen, he said.</p>  <p>""The flu vaccine will prevent influenza virus and the influenza virus only,"" Offit said. ""Certainly we see a lot of mixed respiratory virus infections in our hospital. We'll see often two viruses that are infecting at the same time. ... That makes it all the more important that you get your flu vaccine.""</p>  <p>Offit stressed that parents should take the flu season seriously. Last year more than 100 youngsters died from influenza, and most of them were healthy at the time. Most had not had a flu shot, Offit said.</p>  <p>""When you look at vaccine preventable diseases in general, like the current measles outbreak, the vast majority of children are unvaccinated,"" he said.</p>  <p>So when's the best time to get vaccinated? Now, says CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. Flu vaccines should be on their way to your doctor's office.</p>  <p>""We are told by the manufacturers they will be bringing approximately 150 million doses of flu vaccine to the market,"" Frieden said Thursday. ""There are many different options out there. And there's plenty of flu vaccine to go around.""</p> "
"291","Flu shot myths addressed","CNN.com","2014-09-25 14:35:35","2014-10-06 06:18:52","http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/11/health/flu-shot-questions/index.html","Health"," <p>1. The shot can give you flu</p>  <p>Not so, says the CDC .</p>  <p>The viruses in flu shots are killed during the production of the vaccine, which means they cannot cause infection. The vaccine batches are then tested, with a group of people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or salt water.</p>  <p>""The only differences in symptoms was increased soreness in the arm and redness at the injection site among people who got the flu shot,"" the CDC found. ""There were no differences in terms of body aches, fever, cough, runny nose or sore throat.""</p>  <p>Still, some people feel bad after a flu shot. Soreness at the injection site is one reason, but it usually dissipates within two days. It's caused by the immune system making antibodies to the killed viruses in the vaccine that help a person fight off the flu.</p>  <p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says symptoms, in rare instances, include fever, muscle pain, and discomfort or weakness, which also typically go away after a day or two.</p>  <p>And, though a flu shot won't give you the flu, its protection doesn't kick in for two weeks from the time of injection. During that time, you are vulnerable.</p>  <p>In addition, it's easy to confuse seasonal flu for an illness caused by a number of other pathogens, including rhinovirus. Or you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the vaccine. Finally, the flu shot does not always work -- particularly among the elderly and people with weak immune systems. But even among these high-risk groups, the vaccine can prevent complications.</p>  <p>2. It is better to get the vaccine later in the season to limit the risk that its efficacy will wane</p>  <p>No. The shot lasts an entire flu season, except for some children who may need two doses. The CDC recommends that all people older than 6 months get a flu vaccine.</p>  <p>3. The flu shot might adversely affect my pregnancy</p>  <p>No. The flu vaccine is ""an essential element of prenatal care"" and is recommended for all pregnant women, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Pregnant women are among the groups at increased risk for flu complications like pneumonia, infections and dehydration.</p>  <p>Though babies cannot be vaccinated until they have reached 6 months of age, antibodies they received in utero from their mothers may help protect them. But note that the group recommends against the nasal spray -- the live, attenuated version -- for pregnant women.</p>  <p>The CDC says seasonal flu vaccine shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies.</p>  <p>4. I've had the flu before and it was no big deal, so bring it on</p>  <p>No. Seasonal flu exacts a bigger toll in some years than in others: Between 1976 and 2007, the flu was linked to a low of 3,000 to as many as 49,000 fatalities in the United States, with more than 200,000 hospitalizations.</p>  <p>There are two main reasons: The viruses that circulate in one year may differ from those that circulate in another. And, of course, people change from year to year, meaning that your response to a viral infection one year may not be the same as your response in another.</p>  <p>5. The flu shot doesn't work</p>  <p>It doesn't work all the time, but it does confer some level of protection. For example, the CDC says preliminary data for the 2010-2011 season show that it was about 60% effective for all age groups combined, and studies for earlier years found protection rates of up to 90%.</p> "

They tested this hypothesis in a study that ran in Behavioral Brain Research this week. Xanthohumol did not have the same impact on older mice.</p>  <p>The dose they gave the mice was quite high -- so high that if you were in this study, you'd actually have to drink 2,000 liters of beer a day to equal what the mice consumed. So scientists don't suggest you run out and buy a six-pack before work.</p>  <p>The research does suggest that this flavonoid and others should be studied closer. The researchers believe it and others, like the ones found in red wine, blueberries and dark chocolate, may play a role in helping you form memories.</p>  <p>Switching to e-cigarettes may not be the answer</p>  <p>There's a big debate over whether doctors should recommend that people try e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking. E-cigarettes contain nicotine, but they don't have all the cancer-causing additives that a regular cigarette has. Studies earlier this year showed they are more effective than the patch or gum in helping quit.</p>  <p>A new study, published in the journal Cancer , disagrees. Researchers concluded that e-cigarette users were no more likely to quit smoking successfully than regular cigarette smokers.</p>  <p>Of regular cigarette smokers enrolled in the study, 44.4% resisted the temptation to smoke for seven days, compared to 43.1% of e-cigarette users.</p>  <p>The study looked at 1,074 patients who had cancer and who were enrolled in a smoking cessation program in a cancer treatment center.

If a person's immune system is picking up on that change, it may be getting the body ready for an allergic response.</p>  <p>Scientists suggest this may explain why so many people in the West, where peanuts are often dry roasted, show signs for peanut allergies when people who live in Asia don't. In Asian countries, peanuts are often served raw or boiled.</p>  <p>Next researchers will try to figure out what chemical changes are happening in the dry roasting process that trigger the attacks, particularly in humans.</p>  <p>You drink more alcohol on days you exercise</p>  <p>Scientists say you are lifting more than weights on the days you hit the gym -- you're throwing back a few cocktails, too.</p>  <p>In a study that ran in the latest edition of Health Psychology, the American Psychologial Association's journal , researchers found that people typically exercise more on Thursdays and Sundays, when they're also drinking more.</p>  <p>The study looked at 150 people between the age of 18 and 89.

The participants were interviewed about migraine symptoms in middle age and then, about 25 years later, asked about Parkinson's disease symptoms. They were also asked about symptoms for a related disorder called Restless Legs Syndrome .</p>  <p>The results were based on the study participants' self-reported diagnoses, though in the majority of the cases researchers confirmed the diagnoses by looking at medical records and the participants' medication use.</p>  <p>""The patients in this study were not carefully examined and definitely diagnosed with Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr. Michael S. Okun, national medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, which is why he believes more research is needed before drawing any conclusion that the two are related.</p>  <p>""Head trauma and other neurological issues can manifest with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease and future studies will need to better control for these factors.""</p>  <p>Compared to those without headaches, people in the study who suffered from migraines with aura in middle age were about twice as likely to have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease when the researchers checked back. They were also more likely to report at least four symptoms commonly associated with Parkinson's disease later in life.</p>  <p>Parkinson's-like symptoms were also more common in those with migraine without aura, though the link was not as strong, lead study author Ann Scher told CNN in an email.</p>  <p>Scher, a professor of epidemiology at Uniformed Services University in Maryland, wants to make sure people understand the actual risk of Parkinson's disease in people with migraine is still very low.</p>  <p>Researchers don't yet understand why migraines might be linked to Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders, Scher says. They don't believe that the link is due to medications taken to treat migraines, some of which block dopamine. Nor do they think that the link is due to related brain diseases, ""since we controlled for these factors.""</p>  <p>Possible explanations for the connection, she agrees, might be a previous head injury or a shared genetic risk factor that increases the risk for both migraine and Parkinson's disease.</p>  <p>One common link may be abnormalities in dopamine production and dopamine receptors in the brain, said Okun. Some groups suggest the same dopamine treatment that helps Parkinson's patients may also help with migraines.</p>  <p>""Another theory is that in migraine sufferers there seems to be a higher deposition of metals, such as iron, in the brain and specifically in areas important to movement,"" said Okun. ""Some experts believe that this metal deposition may place patients at risk for diseases like Parkinson's.""</p> "

Nothing terrible, but not following me around the room with his eyes,"" Hinson said. With two older children who have autism, she worried little Noah was headed in that same direction. ""No one was super concerned, but at 9 months he was showing significant delays.""</p>  <p>A child isn't typically diagnosed with autism until age 3 or later. While the signs for autism spectrum disorder , or ASD, may be hard to detect in infants, researchers suggest there may be some early indications if you know what to watch for.</p>  <p>Children with autism often don't produce many sounds or use their voices to communicate. They may engage in frequent repetitive behavior. They stare at their hands or at objects for long periods of time.</p>  <p>Sally Rogers , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral studies at UC Davis MIND Institute , wondered what would happen if a parent could intervene before a child is officially diagnosed with autism. Other research on early intervention has shown some promise .</p>  <p>Rogers asked Hinson if she would be interested in becoming part of a study . Since the study involved behavioral modification therapy, if Noah wasn't diagnosed with autism there would be no harm. Hinson said yes, as did six other parents with children between the ages of 7 months and 15 months who showed some signs of autism.</p>  <p>""As a parent, I'll take anything that can help my child,"" Hinson said.</p>  <p>Autism rates now 1 in 68 U.S. children</p>  <p>For the study, she and the other parents visited Rogers' clinic once a week for 12 weeks. There the researchers taught the parents behavioral modification techniques they could use on their children.</p>  <p>The techniques were simple exercises: Hinson would play ""piggies"" with Noah, reciting the classic poem about pigs going to market and touching Noah's feet. Often children with autism become distressed when they are touched. Other times she would play ""airplane"" with Noah's food as she fed him. Or they'd focus on songs and rhymes.</p>  <p>""Basic things you do as a mom, but really are cuing into the responses he is making and really reinforcing the responses to get him to engage with me,"" Hinson said. ""The wonderful thing about it was that most of what they taught me, they taught me how to use in my general day-to-day routines with Noah.""</p>  <p>Scientists thought parents would be more apt to do exercises that could be woven into daily life.</p>  <p>At about 15 months in, there were still concerns, but Hinson had noticed improvement in Noah's interactions with her. At 18 months, he seemed to be back on track developmentally.</p>  <p>""It was like this beautiful thing happened.""</p>  <p>Autism is growing up</p>  <p>Noah didn't just catch up to the developmental goals of other children his age, he surpassed them. He remained talkative and engaged.</p>  <p>""This completely helped him,"" she said. ""I don't know what would have happened (otherwise).""</p>  <p>She was not alone. At 36 months, the group that had used the behavioral intervention techniques with their children had much lower rates for autism spectrum disorder. Five children no longer showed symptoms of autism, one had mild autism but no developmental delays, and one had severe autism.</p>  <p>Today Noah is a 4-year-old boy with extensive language skills.</p>  <p>The scientists behind the study caution that this is only a pilot study; the findings cannot be applied to a larger population yet.</p>  <p>""With seven (children) you can't draw a conclusion,"" Rogers said.</p>  <p>But other researchers in the field see real promise in the results.</p>  <p>""It is exciting to think about an intervention that could change the developmental outcome for babies at risk of autism spectrum disorder,"" said Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele , an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. ""This pilot study ... suggests that parents can be trained to interact with their at-risk infants using many of the same principles that are used for toddlers and preschoolers with ASD.""</p>  <p>""It begins to set the scene for future randomized, controlled studies to evaluate whether this type of intervention could actually prevent babies from developing full symptoms of autism spectrum disorder,"" Veenstra-VanderWeele said. If it proves to work on a larger group, this ""would be a truly transformative finding.""</p> "

Questions remain about the extent to which ZMapp was responsible for the patients' recovery, but demand for the drug has skyrocketed.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, the process used to make the doses given to Brantly, Writebol and a few other patients is costly and time-consuming. Public health officials are now looking for ways to develop more of this experimental drug quickly.</p>  <p>Tobacco plants may hold the key.</p>  <p>In the world of health and medicine, the word tobacco usually brings to mind cancer, emphysema and heart disease. But in recent years the plant's tarnished reputation is getting a makeover from the development of pharmaceuticals through an effective, swift and cost-cutting technique that has been dubbed ""biopharming.""</p>  <p>Tobacco plant-based drugs are not a new concept. But there are no treatments currently developed through tobacco plants that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That may change as the deadly Ebola virus continues to spread through West Africa, where it has killed more than 3,300.</p>  <p>Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro was one of the first biopharmaceutical companies tasked with developing the ZMapp serum through tobacco plants. The company has been working in collaboration with San Diego-based Mapp Biophamaceutical, which developed the ZMapp vaccine, since August.</p>  <p>Eyes have also turned to Texas-based biotechnology company Caliber Biotherapeutics, which that same month claimed it was ready to fast-track the drug if need be. The company, which says it operates the largest tobacco-based pharmaceutical facility in the world, has been working on cutting costs and increasing quantities of certain cancer drugs through genetically modified tobacco.</p>  <p>Drugs and vaccines are manufactured in a variety of ways. Flu vaccines , for example, are most commonly produced by injecting fertilized hen eggs with the virus. The virus is incubated for days so it can replicate, be harvested, inactivated or weakened, and then made into either a flu shot or nasal spray.</p>  <p>The process can cost around $150 million each year, using $600,000 eggs each day. Tobacco plants can produce antibodies in much less time for a fraction of the cost, advocates say.</p>  <p>The process begins by cloning a gene and inserting it into a virus. That infected gene is then injected into the tobacco plant, where it multiplies within the leaves before it is extracted and purified.</p>  <p>Unlike with egg-based and mammalian cell-based products, each tobacco plant can produce enough antibodies for dozens of doses of a pharmaceutical, experts say. The plants are also easy to contain and manufacture in controlled environments such as greenhouses.</p>  <p>Medicago Inc., a biopharmaceutical company in North Carolina, produced 10 million flu vaccines in 30 days using tobacco plants in a federally funded effort called "" Blue Angel ."" The program tested the prospect of rapid vaccine production in the hypothetical case of a global health pandemic. It is estimated the company could make as many as 100 million doses for as little as $36 million.</p>  <p>The Canadian biopharmaceutical company PlantForm is using tobacco to produce a drug that reduces the growth rate of breast cancer tumors. The drug is a "" biosimilar "" form of a current drug on the market called Herceptin, usually produced by creating antibodies in mammalian cells from hamsters' ovaries.</p>  <p>The current treatment costs up to $100,000 per patient , according to PlantForm. The company estimates up to $120 million could be saved by 2017 by manufacturing the drug with tobacco plants instead.</p>  <p>One of the pioneering programs to use tobacco for vaccine manufacturing is the University of Louisville's Owensboro Cancer Research Program in Kentucky.</p>  <p>Since 2007, it has used a relative of tobacco, called nicotiana benthamiana , to develop vaccines for everything from cholera to cervical cancer. In August, the center announced it had received a $14.7 million grant to produce a gel made from crushed tobacco leaves that prevents HIV transmission.</p>  <p>The process involves isolating a protein called griffithsin , which can be found in red algae. The protein fends off HIV by sticking onto the outer surface of an HIV-infected cell, shielding noninfected cells from the virus. Once isolated, the protein is injected into the tobacco plant and then extracted 12 days later. It is then crushed, purified and mixed into a gel that can be used as a lubricant.</p>  <p>""Our hope is for the gel to be as effective as the condom,"" senior scientist Dr. Kenneth Palmer said.</p>  <p>Palmer, a native of Zimbabwe, has been studying plant-based pharmaceuticals since 1997 when he received his doctorate at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.</p>  <p>Before working with tobacco, Palmer studied the prospects of using corn to develop pharmaceuticals. But while edible plants are just as well-suited as tobacco for biopharming, Palmer said they are not the way to go:</p>  <p>""You don't want to risk contaminating the food supply with pharmaceuticals.""</p>  <p>Your Ebola questions answered</p>  <p>One company learned that the hard way.</p>  <p>In 2002, ProdiGene, a biopharmaceutical company based out of College Station, Texas, was fined $3 million after a corn-produced vaccine for diabetes and diarrhea nearly contaminated a crop of soybeans in Nebraska and Iowa.</p>  <p>The incident ignited a massive backlash against the development of plant-based pharmaceuticals, and the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture implemented new and stricter regulations for field-testing of pharmaceuticals engineered through food crops.</p>  <p>To date, there is only one plant-based pharmaceutical approved by the FDA: Elelyso , which contains an enzyme engineered through carrot cells. The medication treats Gaucher's disease , a rare genetic disorder that stops cells and organs from functioning properly.</p>  <p>Palmer doesn't blame the FDA for the bottleneck in biopharmaceutical approval. Rather, he concedes that compared with competing technology used to make pharmaceuticals, biopharming is still relatively new. He sees the success of ZMapp as a big catalyst for movement in the industry:</p>  <p>""Unfortunate as it is, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a huge leg up for the field,"" Palmer said. ""I think it will only help validate the technology as a viable option.""</p>  <p>Complete coverage on Ebola</p> "

In its simplest and most universal form, yoga is intended to help you feel and move better. So tying your shoes without wrenching your back or pulling a hamstring is a very realistic and admirable goal for any yoga newbie.</p>  <p>When it comes to toe touching, it's logical to assume you should stretch the backs of your legs. However, the biomechanics of a forward bend include not only the hamstrings -- the major muscle group of the back of your legs -- but many other muscles that support hip and pelvic movement.</p>  <p>Tight low back? Hip tension? Your low-back extensors and hip flexors must function correctly for the pelvis to flex forward. If these muscles are tense or dysfunctional, you can't bend properly, and you risk hamstring tears and chronic back and hip pain. Yikes!</p>  <p>The good news is that practicing these five yoga poses daily will have you doing your own pedicures in no time.</p>  <p>1. Ragdoll</p>  <p>Unlike a full forward fold, this pose is a gentler version, enabling you to gradually deepen the stretch while focusing on proper pelvic alignment, hip hinging and hamstring lengthening.</p>  <p>Standing with your feet hip-distance apart, exhale as you bend forward, hinging from your hips, rather than pulling from your low back. Clasp your hands around the opposite elbow and let your head hang loosely. With your weight evenly distributed in your feet (not just your heels), straighten your legs by engaging your quadriceps (the muscles of the front upper leg).</p>  <p>Firing your quad muscles allows your hamstrings to relax. You'll also want to engage your deep core muscles to release your low back during this stretch. Remain here for 10 long, deep breaths.</p>  <p>2. Functional squat</p>  <p>Many people can't squat deeply without arching their backs, lifting their heels and/or spreading their knees. This is due to overactive low-back muscles and hip flexors as well as tension in their calves and the outside of their hips. Practicing this pose addresses all of those areas and helps your pelvis move more freely.</p>  <p>Start with your feet and knees aligned under your hips with your arms reaching out at shoulder height. Exhale as you sit back into the pose as deeply as possible without knees splaying or heels lifting. Hold for three long, deep breaths. Repeat three times.</p>  <p>3. Kneeling lunge</p>  <p>Tight hip flexors can hold you in a pelvic tilt that inhibits forward bending. Kneeling lunge is a great pose for releasing them.</p>  <p>Step into a basic lunge position with your back knee bent. Rest your hands on your front thigh as you exhale and let your pelvis sink downward. Keep your hips squared forward. Engage your buttocks to increase the stretch in your hip flexors. Hold for five long, deep breaths on each side.</p>  <p>4. Pyramid</p>  <p>When done correctly, the pyramid pose stretches your hamstrings with proper pelvic alignment.</p>  <p>Step one leg back 18 to 24 inches with your toes angled slightly out. With both legs straight, hinge from your hips to bend forward, placing your hands on your forward leg as low as possible without rounding your back.</p>  <p>To establish proper pelvic alignment, draw your forward hip back while pushing your back hip forward. Engage your quadriceps to keep your legs straight and stretch your hamstrings. Hold for five long, deep breaths on each side.</p>  <p>5. Extended child's pose</p>  <p>This pose is a restful one intended to stretch low-back extensors and encourage the pelvis out of an anterior tilt.</p>  <p>From a kneeling position, reach your arms forward as you exhale and press your hips back toward your heels. Rest your forehead on the floor or a block. Hold for five long, deep breaths.</p> "

While around 90% of Americans know that smoking is linked to higher rates of cancer, Dr. Clifford Hudis says, the inverse is true for obesity and cancer; less than 10% of us realize how fat is related to this chronic disease.</p>  <p>""Obesity is a major, under-recognized contributor to the nation's cancer toll and is quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer,"" Hudis and his colleagues at the American Society of Clinical Oncology write in a new position paper.</p>  <p>In fact, as many as 84,000 cancer diagnoses each year are linked to obesity, according to the National Cancer Institute . Excess fat also affects how cancer treatments work and may increase a cancer patient's risk of death, either from cancer or from other related causes.</p>  <p>The key word, Hudis says, is preventable. While we can't change the fact that we're all getting older (incidence rates for most cancers increase as patients age), we can change our weight through diet, exercise, sleep and stress management.</p>  <p>The link</p>  <p>In 2003, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a study that included more than 900,000 American adults. Researchers followed the healthy study participants for 16 years, and found the heaviest participants were more likely to develop and die from cancer than participants who were at a healthy weight.</p>  <p>After their analysis, the study authors concluded that excess fat ""could account for 14% of all deaths from cancer in men and 20% of those in women.""</p>  <p>Since then, research has simply strengthened the link between obesity and cancer. Studies have found a relationship between weight and the risk of as many as 12 cancers, says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, including endometrial, colorectal, esophageal, kidney and pancreatic cancers.</p>  <p>A recent report published in the American Association for Cancer Research's journal predicted the top cancer killers in the United States by 2030 will be lung, pancreas and liver -- in part because of rising obesity rates.</p>  <p>The science behind it</p>  <p>""It's not enough to say there's an association between obesity and cancer. We need to know why,"" Hudis says. ""With the why, we can do something about it.""</p>  <p>Scientists are exploring several hypotheses on how excess fat increases a person's risk for cancer. The answer may be slightly different for each type of cancer, but the encompassing explanation seems to be that obesity triggers changes in how the body operates, which can cause harmful cell growth and cell division.</p>  <p>Many of these changes may be linked to inflammation. In general, inflammation occurs when your body is reacting to something out of the norm -- say a virus or a splinter in your foot. Obesity seems to cause chronic inflammation, which in turn may promote cancer development.</p>  <p>Take for example, Hudis says, hormone-sensitive breast cancers . Chemicals in the body meant to regulate inflammation also increase production of the hormone estrogen. And studies have shown excess estrogen can cause breast cancer tumors.</p>  <p>Fat tissue also produces hormones called adipokines, which can stimulate or inhibit cell growth, according to a fact sheet from the oncology society. If these hormones are out of balance, the body may not be able to properly fight cell damage.</p>  <p>Let's talk about sex... and cancer</p>  <p>Treatment and mortality</p>  <p>Obesity can affect a cancer patient's outcome from diagnosis to remission, Hudis says.</p>  <p>Obesity-related pain or unbalanced hormone levels may distract patients from the early warning signs of some cancers. Fatty tissue can also make it difficult for doctors to see tumors on imaging scans. And a late diagnosis often means a lower chance for survival .</p>  <p>The relationship between cancer and obesity also matters after diagnosis. Cancer treatments, such as radiation or chemotherapy, may be hindered by a patient's size. If the patient needs surgery, studies show excess fat puts them at a higher risk of complications, infections and death.</p>  <p>Tumor Paint: Changing the way surgeons fight cancer</p>  <p>A recent study of 80,000 breast cancer patients found that pre-menopausal women with a BMI over 30 had a 21.5% chance of dying, compared to women with an average BMI who had a 16.6% chance of death.</p>  <p>Remaining obese as a survivor can also increase your risk of developing what's called a secondary cancer , the authors of this new position paper say.</p>  <p>What you can do to reduce your ris k</p>  <p>In general, ""people should be aware that overweight and obesity, as common as they are in our population, have serious consequences,"" Hudis says. ""Cancer is really just another one.""</p>  <p>Start reducing your risk now: Stay active. Eat nutritious foods that are low in calories. Get seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Manage your stress levels. All these behaviors will help you reach a healthy weight.</p>  <p>11 simple weight loss tips</p>  <p>If you or someone you know is a cancer survivor, talk to your oncologist. He or she should be aware of the link between cancer and obesity, Hudis says, and able to help you find resources in your community.</p>  <p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology is recommending more research be done on weight loss in the cancer survivor population to determine the best intervention method -- and whether losing weight after a diagnosis improves patient outcomes. The results of these future studies could help persuade insurance providers to reimburse patients for weight management programs.</p> "

And our safety is protected by an unlikely source -- the bright blue blood of the horseshoe crab.</p>  <p>The helmet-shaped creature has developed a unique defense to compensate for its vulnerability to infection in shallow waters. When faced with toxins produced by bacteria, amebocyte cells in the blood -- colored blue by their copper-based molecules -- identify and congeal around the invading matter, trapping the threat inside a gel-like seal that prevents it from spreading.</p>  <p>Nature's method is now utilized on a grand scale. Over 600,000 crabs are captured each year during the spring mating season, to ""donate"" around 30% of their blood in a handful of specialist facilities in the United States and Asia. The blood is worth $60,000 a gallon in a global industry valued at $50 million a year.</p>  <p>Read: The people with someone else's face</p>  <p>An extract has been used in the industry-standard limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) contamination test since the 1970s -- replacing a rabbit-based system. Forty-five minutes of exposure to the crab's blood is enough to reveal endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria which otherwise avoid detection, and is sensitive enough to isolate a threat the equivalent size of a grain of sand in a swimming pool. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that intravenous drugs and any medical equipment coming in contact with the body must first pass through the crab's blood, from needles to surgical implants including pacemakers. As a result, thousands more of us survive such procedures.</p>  <p>The method is established but undergoes constant improvement, according to John Dubczak, General Manager at Charles River Laboratories , which manufactures and globally distributes LAL products.</p>  <p>""Detection is down to one part per trillion,"" he said. ""But we can take it down to a tenth of a trillion, and further orders of magnitude more sensitive.""</p>  <p>Charles River has adapted the system into a more resource-efficient, handheld kit requiring as little as 5% of the blood solution. Such systems can be applied outside the lab and break new frontiers, such as on a trip the International Space Station.</p>  <p>""The test was used to determine if certain types of bacteria were present on various space station surfaces,"" said Norman Wainwright, the facility's director of Research and Development. Further, the system could ""help perform biological studies necessary for an extended human presence in space, from crew health and spacecraft environmental studies to the search for life elsewhere in the solar system.""</p>  <p>Read: These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine</p>  <p>The blood is finding other uses on Earth too. Japanese scientists have devised a test for fungal infections with it, and further research is developing anti-viral and anti-cancer treatment through the same principle of isolating and trapping threats.</p>  <p>As the applications and their value multiplies, efforts have increased to develop alternative tests, rather than rely on harvesting the crabs. One approach uses an electronic chip that provides an alert when in contact with contaminants. Another system using liquid crystals, developed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison , could offer similar detection ability at lower cost.</p>  <p>""The (Wisconsin) literature claims to surpass the sensitivity and specificity for finding toxins, so false positives are not a serious problem,"" says Dr. Peter B. Armstrong, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at the University of California. ""But nothing has gone to the level of FDA approval to show it is yet a viable alternative to LAL test. Knowing the cost and difficulty of obtaining FDA tests, it may be some time before any alternative is out there on the market.""</p>  <p>The urgency may increase with reports of horseshoe crab numbers declining, for a variety of reasons, with the world's largest population in Delaware Bay reportedly reduced by between 75% and 90% in the last 15 years . Although there are welfare procedures in harvesting the blood, between 10-30% of donor crabs die in the process. One recent study showed that survivors are also impaired after release and often incapable of mating, further threatening the population.</p>  <p>""It's difficult because the blood is crucial for human health issues but the biomedical industry needs to keep the population steady,"" says Christopher Chabot, a biology professor at Plymouth State, who led the study. ""We suggest decreasing the time they are out of water, and maintaining an ambient temperature for transportation ... there is a lesser mortality rate if you keep them cool.""</p>  <p>Ultimately, Chabot believes an alternative is necessary to reduce the strain on the population, through both conservation programs and the development of a synthetic substitute. It is not clear what expiry date there is on the lifesaving services of the horseshoe crab, but without it medicine faces a return to the dark ages.</p>  <p>Read: The people with someone else's face</p>  <p>Read: These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine</p>  <p>Read: Hunting down 'fiery serpent' disease</p> "

He left behind my wife Michelle and I, a heartbroken twin brother named Troy and his loving big sister Tara. Our family has been devastated by this loss.</p>  <p>I miss my son every second of every day.</p>  <p>By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer, I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone.</p>  <p>A week before Cole died in our arms, he looked up at me and said, ""I'm not going to grow up to be or do anything."" Can you imagine hearing your child speak such words? Fighting back tears, I promised my son he would do ""something big"" someday.</p>  <p>For two years now I have been fighting around the clock to fulfill my promise to my son. I do this in hopes that greater awareness will lead to desperately needed funding and research, so children can receive more humane treatments and have a better chance of survival, with fewer future complications.</p>  <p>Pediatric cancer kills more kids in the United States than any other disease. And more than 11,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Yet the National Cancer Institute devotes just 4% of its budget toward pediatric cancer research. Surely these statistics speak of the dire need for increased funding to fight pediatric cancer.</p>  <p>I began my mission to increase childhood cancer awareness in August 2012. My dream was to see as much gold in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month as there is pink in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The awareness generated by the breast cancer community has led to earlier detection, newer and improved treatments, and higher survival rates for those fighting breast cancer.</p>  <p>I just wanted the same for kids fighting cancer.</p>  <p>I started reaching out to officials at bridges, buildings and landmarks across the United States, asking that they light gold in September to help increase awareness. I was successful in getting many to agree: the Prudential Building, the Zakim Bridge and the TD Garden in Boston; the battleship New Jersey and the Liberty Bridge in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>  <p>Many others across the United States began to reach out to structures in their hometowns.</p>  <p>Our movement to go gold in September even took root in countries such as Ireland, Australia, Canada and Switzerland. Last year, there was more gold displayed in September across the world than ever before, and we are just beginning.</p>  <p>Please display gold this September to help shed light on the monster that afflicts so many of our children. Lighting gold is the first step toward greater awareness of childhood cancer -- awareness that will hopefully lead to increased funding, which will lead to more research, that will hopefully lead to a cure for all types of childhood cancer.</p>  <p>But there is another reason to light gold: It helps to heal the hearts of parents such as myself who have lost children to cancer. It lets us know our children did not die in vain. It shows us our kids are not forgotten.</p>  <p>My son received most of his treatments at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. After my son died, I had a difficult time going back to Boston; there were too many painful memories there. But last September, I returned to see many of the landmarks we had crossed and passed by so often illuminated with gold lights.</p>  <p>I smiled, with tears streaming down my cheeks, looking at the buildings and bridges shining gold and thought:</p>  <p>You are doing ""something big"" Cole!</p> "

Four children in Boston also match the criteria for this illness, doctors say.</p>  <p>The mother of one of the Colorado children described the family's ""scary experience"" at a telebriefing on Friday.</p>  <p>It started with a cough. Then the girl became lethargic and her fever rose.</p>  <p>Her mom took her to the doctor, but the girl's blood work looked fine.

""She kept dropping her corn on the cob."" Almost two weeks after the illness started, the girl was admitted to the hospital.</p>  <p>Some of the children in Colorado and Boston have tested positive for enterovirus D68, a virus that has been sending children around the country to the hospital with severe respiratory illness.

The virus is very common, especially in the late summer and early fall, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States.</p>  <p>Yet the deaths do raise an alarm because this year has been worse than some other years, since enterovirus D68 has been sending more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems.</p>  <p>As of Wednesday, the CDC had confirmed 500 people in 42 states have respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus D68.</p>  <p>Those infected include Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island.

Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria resistant to many antibiotics, while sepsis is an illness affecting all parts of the body that springs up in response to an infection, according to the CDC.</p>  <p>That determination notwithstanding, Fine also noted that ""cultures also showed the presence of enterovirus D68.""

Most staph infections are easily treated with antibiotics, according to the National Institutes of Health , but some strains of the bacteria are resistant to these medications, making them harder to treat.</p>  <p>Antibiotic-resistant infections has been a big public health issue the past few years. In September, President Barack Obama signed an executive order establishing an interagency task force charged with developing a national strategy to combat these dangerous bacteria strains.</p>  <p>The Rhode Island Department of Health recommends parents and children follow these steps to prevention infection:</p>  <p>-- Wash hands often with soap and warm water five or six times a day for at least 20 seconds.</p>  <p>-- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>  <p>-- Make sure your child is taking asthma medications as prescribed.</p>  <p>-- Disinfect toys, doorknobs, phones, computers and other surfaces often.</p>  <p>-- Avoid close contact and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick.</p>  <p>-- Stay home if you are sick.</p>  <p>-- Seek medical attention right away if your child is having trouble breathing.</p> "

They say the chances are relatively small that Ebola will make that jump.

While around 90% of Americans know that smoking is linked to higher rates of cancer, Dr. Clifford Hudis says, the inverse is true for obesity and cancer; less than 10% of us realize how fat is related to this chronic disease.</p>  <p>""Obesity is a major, under-recognized contributor to the nation's cancer toll and is quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer,"" Hudis and his colleagues at the American Society of Clinical Oncology write in a new position paper.</p>  <p>In fact, as many as 84,000 cancer diagnoses each year are linked to obesity, according to the National Cancer Institute . Excess fat also affects how cancer treatments work and may increase a cancer patient's risk of death, either from cancer or from other related causes.</p>  <p>The key word, Hudis says, is preventable. While we can't change the fact that we're all getting older (incidence rates for most cancers increase as patients age), we can change our weight through diet, exercise, sleep and stress management.</p>  <p>The link</p>  <p>In 2003, the New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a study that included more than 900,000 American adults. Researchers followed the healthy study participants for 16 years, and found the heaviest participants were more likely to develop and die from cancer than participants who were at a healthy weight.</p>  <p>After their analysis, the study authors concluded that excess fat ""could account for 14% of all deaths from cancer in men and 20% of those in women.""</p>  <p>Since then, research has simply strengthened the link between obesity and cancer. Studies have found a relationship between weight and the risk of as many as 12 cancers, says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, including endometrial, colorectal, esophageal, kidney and pancreatic cancers.</p>  <p>A recent report published in the American Association for Cancer Research's journal predicted the top cancer killers in the United States by 2030 will be lung, pancreas and liver -- in part because of rising obesity rates.</p>  <p>The science behind it</p>  <p>""It's not enough to say there's an association between obesity and cancer. We need to know why,"" Hudis says. ""With the why, we can do something about it.""</p>  <p>Scientists are exploring several hypotheses on how excess fat increases a person's risk for cancer. The answer may be slightly different for each type of cancer, but the encompassing explanation seems to be that obesity triggers changes in how the body operates, which can cause harmful cell growth and cell division.</p>  <p>Many of these changes may be linked to inflammation. In general, inflammation occurs when your body is reacting to something out of the norm -- say a virus or a splinter in your foot. Obesity seems to cause chronic inflammation, which in turn may promote cancer development.</p>  <p>Take for example, Hudis says, hormone-sensitive breast cancers . Chemicals in the body meant to regulate inflammation also increase production of the hormone estrogen. And studies have shown excess estrogen can cause breast cancer tumors.</p>  <p>Fat tissue also produces hormones called adipokines, which can stimulate or inhibit cell growth, according to a fact sheet from the oncology society. If these hormones are out of balance, the body may not be able to properly fight cell damage.</p>  <p>Let's talk about sex... and cancer</p>  <p>Treatment and mortality</p>  <p>Obesity can affect a cancer patient's outcome from diagnosis to remission, Hudis says.</p>  <p>Obesity-related pain or unbalanced hormone levels may distract patients from the early warning signs of some cancers. Fatty tissue can also make it difficult for doctors to see tumors on imaging scans. And a late diagnosis often means a lower chance for survival .</p>  <p>The relationship between cancer and obesity also matters after diagnosis. Cancer treatments, such as radiation or chemotherapy, may be hindered by a patient's size. If the patient needs surgery, studies show excess fat puts them at a higher risk of complications, infections and death.</p>  <p>Tumor Paint: Changing the way surgeons fight cancer</p>  <p>A recent study of 80,000 breast cancer patients found that pre-menopausal women with a BMI over 30 had a 21.5% chance of dying, compared to women with an average BMI who had a 16.6% chance of death.</p>  <p>Remaining obese as a survivor can also increase your risk of developing what's called a secondary cancer , the authors of this new position paper say.</p>  <p>What you can do to reduce your ris k</p>  <p>In general, ""people should be aware that overweight and obesity, as common as they are in our population, have serious consequences,"" Hudis says. ""Cancer is really just another one.""</p>  <p>Start reducing your risk now: Stay active. Eat nutritious foods that are low in calories. Get seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Manage your stress levels. All these behaviors will help you reach a healthy weight.</p>  <p>11 simple weight loss tips</p>  <p>If you or someone you know is a cancer survivor, talk to your oncologist.

"308","Doctors: Think twice about 'the pill' for teens","CNN.com","2014-09-29 18:44:06","2014-10-06 06:21:39","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/29/health/birth-control-options-teens/index.html","Health"," <p>An updated policy statement released today by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests doctors counsel teens about the advantages of other birth control options -- like intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) or birth control implants -- before the pill.</p>  <p>""On some level, when people see 'teens should have IUDs,' it sounds surprising,"" said Dr. Mary Ott , associate professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine, and one of the lead authors of the policy statement.</p>  <p>The AAP ""is not recommending that young people have sex. It is recognizing that young people will have sex and we want them to be safe and protected with the most effective methods available.""</p>  <p>For the uninitiated, the pill is taken on a daily basis to inhibit ovulation. And that detail -- taking it daily -- is part of why unintended pregnancy occurs about 9% of the time for this method among adults. Experts say the rates are likely higher among teens.</p>  <p>The failure rate for IUDs -- a T-shaped device inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy -- and implants is less than 1%.</p>  <p>IUDs and implants are more effective, in part because the risk of failure and pregnancy does not hinge on taking a pill daily. They are implanted and last for years, not days -- part of a category of contraceptives called long-acting reversible contraception, or LARC .</p>  <p>""Adult women can't remember to take the pill every day,"" said Dr. Tonya Chaffee , director of the Teen and Young Adult Health Center at San Francisco General Hospital. ""How should we expect adolescents to remember?""</p>  <p>It would seem to be simple: Use the most effective birth control methods, and rates of teen pregnancy -- and maybe even abortions and STDs -- could plummet. It is what happened when health officials in Colorado introduced low-cost IUDs to young women at high risk of pregnancy: The state's teen birth rate dropped 40%.</p>  <p>Colorado teen birthrate drops 40% with low-cost option</p>  <p>But the conversation is far from simple. American culture is still skittish about the idea of teens having sex, say experts. That makes practical conversations about contraception between doctors and teenagers that much more difficult, says Chaffee.</p>  <p>""Our culture in general is so afraid of sex, and that has led to high adolescent pregnancy and STD (sexually transmitted disease) rates,"" she said.</p>  <p>According to a 2012 study , U.S. teens are about twice as likely to give birth as teens in Canada; four times as likely as teens in Germany.</p>  <p>""Teen pregnancy rates in the United States are unacceptable,"" said Ott. ""It's not about differences in sexual behavior. What's different is we don't use contraceptives as well as kids in other countries.""</p>  <p>Not as well and not as often, said Ott.</p>  <p>One way to broach this issue is by parents and doctors broadening their talks with teens, said Chaffee.</p>  <p>""The conversation should be more above the waist, not just about latex and IUDs,"" said Chaffee, adding that conversations should be about relationships, break-ups, cheating, falling in love, trust and self-respect.</p>  <p>""We don't have those conversations -- that's the problem,"" said Chaffee, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. ""So we're not preparing (teens) in an adequate way.</p>  <p>""Once we get to that level, having the conversation about what kind of birth control to use is easy.""</p> "
"309","How to become a morning person","CNN.com","2014-09-30 11:27:10","2014-10-06 06:21:40","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/30/health/become-morning-person/index.html","Health"," <p>The good news is only two in 10 fall into the category of night owls, while the rest fall somewhere in between. Better still: Even if you operate best in the wee hours, you can still train yourself to be an early riser.</p>  <p>Here's how:</p>  <p>DailyBurn: 10 reasons you're exhausted and what to do about it</p>  <p>Plan ahead</p>  <p>Waking well-rested starts with getting enough sleep .</p>  <p>""Hitting the snooze button a couple times before getting up is a clear sign of sleep deprivation,"" says Dr. Nathaniel Watson, president-elect of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ""If you are getting enough sleep, you should be able to wake up on time without a morning alarm.""</p>  <p>Sounds easier said than done? First, follow these tips for catching the zzz's you need to wake refreshed.</p>  <p>DailyBurn: How much sleep do you really need?</p>  <p>1. Practice good sleep hygiene . ""Keeping a consistent sleep schedule is one of the best ways to ensure you're getting quality, restful sleep,"" says Watson. If you need to shift your schedule earlier, start moving your bedtime forward by just 15 minutes at a time. Adjustments more drastic than that will keep you rebounding between early and late bedtimes rather than creating lasting change.</p>  <p>2. Take your time . Balancing your own well-being against other personal and professional responsibilities is tough. Often, finding the right work-life equilibrium starts with saying, ""No,"" — and so does getting enough sleep. Pare down your evening commitments so that you've got an hour completely blocked off to wind down before bed.</p>  <p>DailyBurn: 10 snacks for better sleep</p>  <p>3. Implement a routine . Establishing a schedule can help clue our bodies in to what's to come. Maintaining a regular evening routine will help chill you out and let your mind know that it's nearly time to fall asleep. For example, that could mean drinking a cup of (decaffeinated) tea and reading for 20 minutes each evening before bed.</p>  <p>4. Nap cautiously . If you have a sleep debt to repay, it's better to nap during the day than to mess up your nightly sleep schedule. That said, you don't want a daytime snooze to keep you up at night. (For more napping tips head here!)</p>  <p>5. Eat (and drink) smar t. Some experts caution against going to bed too full or too hungry, as the discomfort may keep you awake. The same goes for drinking: Sipping too much before bed can cause mid-slumber trips to the bathroom, and caffeine and alcohol in particular have been shown to disrupt sleep.</p>  <p>6. Power down . Any kind of light can shift circadian rhythms, making it harder to sleep at night. And if you're constantly plugged in, you're even less likely to hit the hay right away. Research has shown that the blue light emitted by electronics like laptops and cell phones disturbs sleep even more than natural light. Turn off those electronic screens at least an hour before bed to make dozing easier.</p>  <p>7. Prep before bed . Wondering what to do with that electronic-free hour? Use the time to get together anything you'll need in the a.m. — like a healthy lunch, make-ahead breakfast , or a gym bag . Shortening your morning to-do list just might make it easier to roll out of bed.</p>  <p>8. Get cozy. Temperature, noise, light and comfort can all impact your ability to sleep well. A cool, quiet room (around 65 degrees) has been shown to be an effective sleep environment. And if your mattress leaves you achy, you've got a good excuse to upgrade -- your health may depend on it! The National Sleep Foundation offers even more recommendations for tweaking all of these for better sleep.</p>  <p>Wake up with ease</p>  <p>You've set yourself up for success and slept like a boss. But the battle isn't won just yet. Here's how to skip the snooze button and hop out of bed when that alarm starts buzzing.</p>  <p>9 . Set your motive . As with any change, it's important to have a tangible reason for waking up early. Come up with a meaningful goal you'll be able to achieve by starting the day earlier, whether that's being able to fit in a morning sweat session or having some extra time to cook a healthy breakfast.</p>  <p>1 0 . Play a mind game . The alarm goes off, and the immediate temptation is to hit snooze. Go ahead, do it -- but then stay out of bed for those next nine minutes. The idea of the so-called ""inverted snooze"" is to ease the pain of waking up by telling yourself you only have to stick it out for nine minutes. Move around, stretch, start brewing coffee -- anything to keep yourself awake. By the time the alarm goes off again you should be awake and alert enough to start your day rather than still grumpy in bed and (likely) hitting snooze again.</p>  <p>1 1 . Bite the bullet . If you naturally wake within minutes of your alarm, it can be tempting to close your eyes and relish in a few more minutes of rest. But you're better off just getting out of bed. When you wake spontaneously, you're likely in a light sleep stage, explains Dr. Watson. Going back to sleep could send you into a deeper sleep stage, making it harder to wake up and start your day.</p>  <p>1 2 . Make moves . Finding the right alarm and where to put it can have a big impact on whether you wake in the morning. Try experimenting with the sound, timing and location of your alarm clock to help yourself get up when you need to. For example, some alarms wake you gradually with pleasant sounds to make the transition into daytime less jarring and more relaxed.</p>  <p>1 3 . Seize the day . Waking up with a groan and thinking about all the things you don't want to do is a terrible way to motivate yourself to get out of bed. Instead, think ahead to the best things you'll do all day to fuel your desire to get up and at 'em.</p>  <p>1 4 . Try an app . There are several apps that promise to get you out of bed in the a.m. For example, Wake n Shake makes you shake your phone in order to turn off the app, while Better Me shares your failure to your Facebook every time you hit snooze. There are also apps, like Sleep Cycle, that use motion sensors to monitor your movement and determine the best time to wake you within a preset window.</p>  <p>1 5 . Brighten up . If you need to draw shades at night to make your room dark or -- shudder -- you need to wake before it's light out, you can't always rely on the sun to wake you. Fortunately, there are gradual light-up alarm clocks that promise to lull you out of sleep less painfully than your standard alarm.</p>  <p>Power through the morning</p>  <p>You've made it! You're out of bed. Now, here's how to get out the door without starting the day in grouch mode.</p>  <p>16. Pare down to-dos . You've already pre-packed your lunch or gym bag, giving you one less thing to worry about before coffee. Look for other ways to streamline your pre-work routine (including taking advantage of your coffee maker's automatic timer!) so you can spend less time rushing through those early hours, and start enjoying them instead.</p>  <p>17. Amp up your productivity . If you're a regular snoozer, cutting out that extra nine minutes (or nine minutes times four or five) earns you bonus time each morning.</p>  <p>Many creatives swear that early morning is the best time to write or think deeply and creatively about projects. Try taking a page from their book and dedicate even just a few minutes first thing in the a.m. to a project of your choice. You may be surprised at how rewarding it feels to start the day with a few tasks already checked off.</p>  <p>18. Eat a healthy breakfast . To be your best self, it's helpful to eat a good breakfast (trust us, morning meetings are better when you're not hangry ). Whole grain carbs plus protein give you a quick hit of energy and keep you going all morning. For an all-in-one solution that you can prep ahead, try these homemade protein bars or overnight oats .</p>  <p>19. Exercise in the morning . Early in the a.m., your willpower stores are at their highest. By the evening, we get too busy and find too many excuses not to exercise. Plus, morning workouts will give you an extra shot of energy to carry you through the day ahead.</p> "

""But you know what is fun? The second run, the third run, the fourth run, the fifth run...""</p>  <p>DailyBurn: The 30 best marathons in the entire world</p>  <p>Whether you're a total beginner intimidated to take those first steps or you've recently taken a wrong turn straight into a running rut , we're here to help you get moving in the right direction. That's why we asked Feller and some of our other favorite running bloggers and coaches, to share their best tips for finding fun on the run.</p>  <p>1. Forget the past</p>  <p>Whatever feelings or fears you associate with running -- leave them in your dust!</p>  <p>""Forget about the coach who made you run as a punishment,"" says Sara Johnson, a coach at Reality Running . ""Forget about those childhood memories of not being 'the athlete.' Just because running wasn't fun for you in the past doesn't mean it can't be now.""</p>  <p>Matt Orlando of The Runner Dad says most initial stumbles are mental . ""Being a runner isn't about speed or skill; it is a mindset,"" he says. ""Whether you run a 4-minute mile or a 15-minute mile, all it takes is a pair of shoes and the desire to get out the door.""</p>  <p>DailyBurn: The 20 most inspiring runners in the U.S.</p>  <p>2. Set a goal</p>  <p>Establishing a goal for each run (even if it's just to not walk!) creates benchmarks of your progress and a sense of accomplishment.</p>  <p>""I used telephone poles when I was getting started,"" says Feller. ""Each time I ran, I told myself to make it to 'one more pole.'""</p>  <p>Eventually, you might find yourself setting even crazier goals, says Elizabeth Maiuolo of Running and the City , ""like running over all of the NYC bridges or covering three different parks in one run.""</p>  <p>3. Slow down</p>  <p>""Don't even think about pace at the beginning,"" says Amanda Loudin, the voice behind Miss Zippy . ""Many people get discouraged at first because they want to run 'fast.' So they go out and kill themselves, then feel dejected and discouraged.""</p>  <p>Coach Ryan Knapp of Out and Back emphasizes running at a conversational pace, meaning you should be able to talk on-the-go. While it may go against the ""No pain. No gain."" mentality, it ""ensures you are building your aerobic endurance and teaching your body to become more efficient, which is the key to running,"" he says.</p>  <p>DailyBurn: 8 anything-but-ordinary treadmills</p>  <p>4. Buddy up</p>  <p>Yes, it can be isolating to run alone, but we say there's plenty of road to share. ""Ask a friend you haven't seen in a while to run with you,"" says Jocelyn Bonneau, better known as Enthusiastic Runner . ""Catch up while running and the miles will fly by as you chat!""</p>  <p>Julie Curtis of ROJ Running adds that your date could also be a romantic one. ""Studies have shown couples who run together, stay together,"" she says. ""Take your crush out for a little jog or reignite passion in your long-term relationship. That post-workout glow could lead to a few more calories burned -- if you know what I'm saying.""</p>  <p>5. Play a game</p>  <p>Remember all those silly road trip games your parents would use to entertain and distract you on long car rides? Even on your feet, you can still take them on the road! Play ""20 Questions"" with a friend or try to find all of the letters of the alphabet on the street signs you pass if you're running solo.</p>  <p>6. Discover the road not taken</p>  <p>If you ate the same food for lunch every day, you'd inevitably get bored, and it's the same with running!</p>  <p>""Slogging along the same path every day can get old really fast,"" says Feller. Blogger Gabrielle Kotkov of Marathons and Macarons suggests picking a place that feels special. ""It could be as simple as the foliage in the park, or the sunset along the river,"" she says. ""I first fell in love with running in the park in autumn.""</p>  <p>Theodora Blanchfield, coach and creator of Preppy Runner agrees, adding that even if you have to travel to your new route first, ""running is the best way to see new spots and explore somewhere new on foot!""</p>  <p>7. Treat yo' self</p>  <p>We hate to sound shallow, but sometimes there's nothing like some new gear to get us going. ""A flashy training outfit will make me want to run faster and longer,"" admits Maiuolo. Michelle Roos of Pawsitively Delightful also abides by this approach.</p>  <p>""If I have time (and money), I will buy either a new pair of shorts or a tank that will act as a reward for all of the hard work that I've done up until then,"" she says. ""If it's something I know I'll want to race in later, I can test it out!""</p>  <p>8. Find a happy ending</p>  <p>If you could have anything waiting for you at the end of a hard run, what would it be? For Emily Halnon of Sweat Once a Day , it's simple. ""Beer,"" she says. ""I recommend ending most runs with a pint of the good stuff.""</p>  <p>Abby Land, who writes Back at Square Zero , believes in the power of brunch. ""You meet a buddy and run/walk to your favorite brunch place,"" she says. ""Woo hoo for brunch!"" And with all the calories you burn running, who could blame Kotkov, who says she's run straight to an ice cream shop before? As for Feller, her ultimate destination reward is ""a dog park, filled with precious puppies."" It's all about what puts a smile on your face.</p>  <p>9. Rise with the sun</p>  <p>Switching up the time of day you run can have a huge impact on your performance and overall mood. While it's tough to roll straight out of bed and into running threads, studies show the early bird gets more than just the worm (and spectacular sunrises). According to research, those who work out in the morning have more energy, a curbed appetite and better sleep (not to mention fewer happy hour cancellations) than those who wait until the evening.</p>  <p>10. Meet your neighbors</p>  <p>Get to know your local running store and area running clubs to find group runs and potential training partners.</p>  <p>""There's group accountability and pressure to keep going, even when you're tired or the weather's not very good,"" says Sara Larsen of Sara Runs . Orlando adds connections to your community are a great way to meet people with similar passion and goals, who are also ""awesome, fun, healthy and typically enjoy helping others.""</p>  <p>11. Pump up the jam</p>  <p>To beat the running blues, many runners turn to tunes. As his blog's name suggests, Gerard Pescatore of The Music of Running says rocking out on the run can be an amazing combination. ""You get to star in your own music video while running!"" he says. ""It also helps pass the time. If I know a song is 7+ minutes long, I figure I can run a mile during it.""</p>  <p>Jessica Hofheimer, creator of Pace of Me , says she saves music ""for those runs when I'm really not 'feeling it' because it always peps me up!"" Maiuolo suggests playlists organized by BPM (beats per minute), but don't forget podcasts or stand-up comedy, too.</p>  <p>12. Hit the trails</p>  <p>Halnon says trail running is anything but boring, and we couldn't agree more. ""I thought it would be impossible for me to fall any harder in love with running, and then I discovered trails,"" she says. ""And since that first step onto some gnarly singletrack, I've learned that running on dirt can make this sport exciting and awesome for just about anyone. Like to look at pretty stuff, too? Go run a trail!""</p>  <p>13. Pick up a good read</p>  <p>Look for sources that will motivate you to learn more and put it into practice. Loudin suggests reading up. ""Buy a running magazine or check out a few running blogs for pointers and inspiration,"" she says. (Hint: All of the bloggers featured here are a great start to your required reading list.)</p>  <p>14. Go naked</p>  <p>When runners talk about going ""naked,"" they ditch their gear. If you're a gadgets-and-gizmos-a-plenty kind of runner, try leaving them behind on your next outing. With no watch to track your every pace per mile and calorie burned, you're more likely to discover the simple joys of a run. ""Running allows you to escape your stress, escape your worries, escape the world,"" says Orlando. ""It can be just you and the road.""</p>  <p>15. Give back</p>  <p>We're not sure there's another sport out there that's as charitable as running. If you can't find the personal motivation to keep putting one foot in front of the other, do it for a cause . It's easy to find racing events that raise funds for the nonprofit organization of your choice, or you can download an app like Charity Miles to make sure each step gives a little something back.</p>  <p>16. Make it an appointment</p>  <p>It may not sound exciting, but making running part of your schedule will give it a greater purpose.</p>  <p>""I always remind myself that it's only 30 or 60 minutes of my day,"" says Danica Newon of Chic Runner . ""Even if I go slow, it's better than doing nothing.""</p>  <p>17. Channel your inner cheerleader</p>  <p>Experiencing the sport from the sidelines, with a cowbell in hand, is one of the best ways to ignite a passion for running. ""Go to a local race and cheer at the finish line!"" says Johnson. ""The excitement and joy of the finishers will be contagious.""</p>  <p>Pescatore encourages other runners as a spectator to help him remember why he loves running. ""It gets me fired up,"" he says. ""The running community is amazing and has pulled me out of my (very introverted) shell.""</p>  <p>18. Race. Race. Race.</p>  <p>""Pick out an upcoming race and actually pay the registration fee,"" says Johnson. ""Paying cold hard cash for something makes it harder to slack off on your training."" With so many events to choose — from colorful fun runs to muddy races to marathons — most runners, including Loudin, agree ""getting into the race environment can be incredibly motivating and inspiring. Find a local 5K as your starting point,"" she suggests.</p>  <p>19. Speed up</p>  <p>Speed workouts may hurt (OK, they hurt a lot), but we promise you certainly won't be bored! ""Running is simple,"" says David Hylton, co-founder of #RunChat and blogger at Running... Because I Can . ""Preventing it from getting boring is simpler.""</p>  <p>It may sound cruel, but try hill repeats for a change of scenery or give intervals a go 'round the track for a very literal change of pace.</p>  <p>20. Share the journey</p>  <p>If these tips from running bloggers are any indication, there's an even larger running community out there that wants you to succeed — so talk about it, tweet about it and blog about it with them!</p>  <p>""Sometimes I would 'hate' running and I felt so shunned by my friends,"" says Curtis. ""But once I shared my thoughts and fears, I found out lots of people experience the same things and it helped me to feel more connected.""</p>  <p>And don't forget to (over)share photographic proof of your workouts! ""Bring your camera to make the run more like a cinematic adventure,"" says Maiuolo.</p>  <p>21. Measure your success</p>  <p>Keep a written log of your life as a runner. If you're an analytical person, says Orlando, ""track your progress through spreadsheets or sites like MapMyRun or RunKeeper."" As you continue to improve and feel more comfortable on your feet, you'll be able to look back and have tangible notes of your training progress. Impressed by your success? Sounds like it's time for more treats!</p>  <p>22. Challenge yourself</p>  <p>Maybe you've done a few local 5Ks and want to take running to the next level. Sign up for a race a few months away that seems a bit out of your league and then chase it down.</p>  <p>""Find races that you know you won't PR in so you can approach it differently,"" says Hylton. ""Whether it has crazy hills or is on a trail or a new distance, you'll avoid falling into a trap of same-old, same-old.""</p>  <p>23. Start streaking</p>  <p>No, we're still not talking about taking clothes off. An official ""running streak"" means you vow to run at least one mile every day for an entire calendar year. We don't think you have to be that extreme to get the idea. Try a shorter streak, like Thanksgiving to New Year's Day in the winter or Memorial Day to Labor Day in the summer. It's still harder than it sounds, but it a great tool to keep you motivated and accountable.</p>  <p>24. Take a break</p>  <p>On the flip side, many runners say they start to learn their real relationship with running when they step away from it. Is it true love or are you mortal enemies?</p>  <p>""If you really hate running and you've tried all the 'tricks,' maybe running isn't for you or it isn't the time for you to be doing it,"" says Curtis.</p>  <p>Hylton agrees, saying a love for running doesn't just happen overnight. ""It's like being in a relationship,"" he says. ""First you like it; then you like it a lot; then something happens and you need a break. Then you come back to it and rediscover what you almost missed. Then you fall in love.""</p>  <p>25. Want the run</p>  <p>Becoming a runner is about recognizing the value in every step along the way. ""You need to want the run you are striving to achieve,"" says Roos. ""If you want to run a marathon at a goal pace, that end goal is what's driving you through the run right in front of you (that you might not want at the time). The want for the end goal needs to be greater!""</p>  <p>Hofheimer agrees it's all about remembering why you run. ""The bigger picture is the most important thing to me,"" she says. ""Running makes me feel alive and strong and connected to myself.""</p>  <p>Maybe running isn't for everyone, but you won't know until you try -- and these are some ways to at least have fun while doing so. But according to Feller, the best tip we can offer is to power through. ""When you're getting started, the fight is as much mental as it is physical,"" she says. ""You want running to be fun right away? I assure you, it's not going to be. But once you can find the mental strength to push through the initial tough ones, the runs that follow will truly be a blast.""</p> "
"311","Is diet soda really any better?","CNN.com","2014-09-30 11:28:09","2014-10-06 06:21:44","http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/24/health/soda-makers-cut-calories/index.html","Health"," <p>The announcement doesn't come as a big surprise; soda makers have been under fire for some time for their contribution to the American obesity epidemic. And the companies' motives probably aren't totally altruistic. As more people start to count calories, consumer demand has risen for diet beverages.</p>  <p>""Full calorie or regularly sweetened beverage consumption is going down and has been going down in the last couple of years,"" American Beverage Association spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger told CNN in June. ""Our companies continue to innovate, to offer options... and consumers are taking advantage of them.""</p>  <p>The calories in beverages primarily come from sugar , Gindlesperger said. To cut calories but keep the taste, soda makers generally substitute in natural or artificial sweeteners.</p>  <p>The result is a low- or no-calorie option that satisfies your sweet tooth.</p>  <p>But, and this is a big but, science hasn't quite finished testing these sweeteners' impact on your body. How do they affect your metabolism? Do the chemicals in the artificial sweeteners pose any risk? While most agencies seem to agree that we can rule out cancer as an ill-effect, the medical community is still deciding whether diet beverages will really help you lose weight.</p>  <p>Real or fake sugar: Does it matter?</p>  <p>Let's start with the good news: cutting calories has been shown time and again to be an effective weight-loss strategy. If you used to drink three 20-ounce bottles of regular Coke every day and you switch to a beverage with zero calories, you're saving yourself around 720 calories a day. Do that for five days and you'll lose a pound (or at least prevent yourself from gaining another one).</p>  <p>One study, funded by the American Beverage Association, found that diet soda drinkers who continued to drink soda while on a diet lost more weight than diet soda drinkers who stopped. The results didn't surprise lead study author, Dr. Jim Hill. Those who had to give up diet soda were relying on more willpower to stick to their diets than those who allowed themselves the small indulgence without the added calories, he says.</p>  <p>Drinking sugarless beverages also helps you adhere to the World Health Organization's recommendation to cut down on sugar consumption. The WHO recommends people consume less than 5% of their daily calories from sugar.</p>  <p>""There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases,"" WHO said in a statement.</p>  <p>Of particular concern, WHO said, is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide.</p>  <p>But using sugar substitutes over a long period of time may also have a detrimental effect on your health.</p>  <p>In 2013, scientists found that diet soda drinkers have the same health issues -- excessive weight gain, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- as regular soda drinkers. This study built on previous research that had found diet soda drinkers had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those who didn't drink soda.</p>  <p>""What the prospective studies actually suggest is that if you go out seven years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, the cohorts of individuals who are consuming diet sodas have much worse health outcomes,"" study author Susan Swithers told CNN.</p>  <p>Why? No one knows for sure, but scientists suspect artificial and natural sweeteners trick your body into thinking it's consuming sugar when it's really not. The body responds just like it would to sugar, which throws your metabolic system out of whack.</p>  <p>""You've messed up the whole system, so when you consume real sugar, your body doesn't know if it should try to process it because it's been tricked by the fake sugar so many times,"" explained Swithers.</p>  <p>10 reasons to give up diet soda</p>  <p>A small study recently published in the journal Nature found that many mice and humans became glucose intolerant after eating or drinking regular doses of aspartame, saccharin or sucralose, common artificial sweeteners.</p>  <p>Glucose intolerance is a sign of metabolic conditions like pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes, depending on the severity.</p>  <p>Artificial sweeteners may also affect our gut bacteria. In a study of 400 humans , scientists noticed study participants' gut bacteria changed after they consumed artificial sweeteners. These bacteria communities in your gastrointestinal system can play a crucial role in how our body processes food.</p>  <p>Bottom line?

""Governments must develop adequate strategies to deal with the epidemic holistically, including tacking both reduction in risk for future generations, and adequately caring for people living with the condition and supporting their friends and family.""</p>  <p>The bottom line is that it's never too late to make some changes to improve your physical and mental well-being.

Challenge your brain.</p>  <p>5. Enjoy social activity.</p>  <p>The 10 warnings signs of Alzheimer's</p>  <p>The strongest evidence exists in linking dementia to a lack of education in early life, hypertension in midlife and smoking and diabetes across a lifetime, according to the new report.</p>  <p>""There's also relatively strong evidence that people in low-education countries have a higher risk for Alzheimer's and other dementias,"" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs for the Alzheimer's Association . ""(This) can be controlled across the lifespan.

These may not be the usual words of a scientist but there is biology behind them. ""People try and run away from things and to forget, but with psychedelic drugs they're forced to confront and really look at themselves,"" he says.</p>  <p>The drugs Carhart-Harris is referring to are hallucinogens such as magic mushrooms -- specifically the active chemical inside them, psilocybin. ""We're beginning to identify the biological basis of the reported mind expansion associated with psychedelic drugs,"" he says. Psilocybin is not addictive and is interesting to researchers for its ability to make users see the world differently. The team at Imperial College has begun to unravel why.</p>  <p>Carhart-Harris scanned the brains of 30 healthy volunteers after they had been injected with psilocybin and found the more primitive regions of the brain associated with emotional thinking became more active and the brain's ""default mode network,"" associated with high-level thinking, self-consciousness and introspection, was disjointed and less active.</p>  <p>""We know that a number of mental illnesses, such as OCD and depression, are associated with excessive connectivity of the brain, and the default mode network becomes over-connected,"" says David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology, who leads the Imperial College team . Nutt was formerly drug adviser to the UK government but was fired in 2009. He ""cannot be both a government adviser and a campaigner against government policy,"" wrote a member of the British Parliament, at the time.</p>  <p>Read: The people with someone else's face</p>  <p>The over-connectivity Nutt describes causes depressed people to become locked into rumination and concentrate excessively on negative thoughts about themselves. ""By disrupting that network [with psilocybin] you can liberate them from those depressive symptoms by showing them it's possible to escape those thoughts,"" he says.</p>  <p>Depression is estimated to affect more than 350 million people around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The current pharmaceutical approach to treatment is with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac, which increase levels of serotonin in the brain to improve moods. But SSRIs are not effective in everyone, take time to show an effect and are generally prescribed for long periods of time to maintain their effect.</p>  <p>Nutt thinks psilocybin could be a game-changer, used as part of a therapeutic package where the mind-altering and confronting nature of psychedelics are combined with therapy to treat people within just one or two doses of treatment. ""We've never had drugs before with an instant effect. This could create a paradigm shift to help people into a different state of thinking that they can then stay in,"" he says.</p>  <p>But he stresses that psilocybin should be administered with professional support as part of medical therapy.</p>  <p>Psilocybin is illegal in many countries and in the United States it is considered a Schedule 1 drug. Schedule 1 drugs ""have a high potential for abuse and serve no legitimate medical purpose in the United States,"" according to the Department of Justice.</p>  <p>The U.S. National Institute of Drug Abuse says that long-term negative effects such as flashbacks, a risk of psychiatric illness and impaired memory have been described in case reports. Some people have frightening experiences while on psilocybin and can experience panic reactions, which may cause them harm to themselves or others.</p>  <p>Read: These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine</p>  <p>This new research, however, has only scratched the surface of the brain and its consciousness. ""The brain is about organizing information and predicting the external world and we think psilocybin disrupts that and makes it more chaotic,"" says Nutt. ""People have hallucinations because instead of seeing the world as the brain expects it to be, you see what the brain is doing.""</p>  <p>This ""chaos"" could potentially treat not only depression, but also addictions, such as smoking and alcoholism, which were the subject of some of the earliest studies on psychedelics in the 1950s and '60s, before laws against the drugs were introduced.</p>  <p>""With psilocybin people feel reorganized [after therapy] and the nature of the reorganization is such that there are effects on attitudes towards addiction,"" explains professor Roland Griffiths from the Johns Hopkins School of medicine.</p>  <p>The Centers for Disease Control estimates there are 42 million smokers in the United States and the habit accounts for one in five deaths each year. Initial studies by Griffiths and his team to treat smoking addiction have found 80% success rates in people quitting the habit up to six months after their treatment. Their studies indicate that psilocybin-based therapy could potentially be quicker and more effective than long-term therapies such as nicotine replacement.</p>  <p>The mechanisms behind the change aren't fully understood but the therapy is thought to increase motivation and self-efficacy so people have more confidence in their ability to quit. ""The default-mode network is about habitual patterns of behavior and decreasing activity in this system may free someone to think differently,"" postulates Griffiths. ""People say their addiction doesn't seem compelling anymore.""</p>  <p>Similar small-scale studies on alcoholism by Michael Bogenschutz at the University of New Mexico have had equally promising results, with the greatest improvements seen in people after they had received psilocybin than after counseling alone. ""The degree of improvement was highly correlated with the intensity of the subjective effects of psilocybin,"" says Bogenshutz.</p>  <p>Psilocybin therapy is still a long way from widespread acceptance and trials need to be conducted on larger scales in controlled settings. ""The early research is promising but further research is needed,"" comments Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, of the UK's Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p>  <p>""It will require much more research to establish whether these drugs work in clinical settings and are safe to use with patients,"" he says.</p>  <p>But the trans-Atlantic teams envision a future of approved clinics administering these mind-alerting psychedelics in a supportive setting to treat various mental ailments. ""It's unlikely to become the mainstream treatment,"" concludes Nutt. ""But it could be used on people [with depression] when SSRIs aren't working.""</p>  <p>Read: The people with someone else's face</p>  <p>Read: These 8 whiz kids are the future of medicine</p>  <p>Read: Why this crab's blood could save your life</p> "

With two MRI scans, they examined the link between sleep problems like insomnia and the study participants' brain volume. The first scan was taken before patients completed a questionnaire pertaining to their sleep habits. The second scan was done approximately 3½ years later.</p>  <p>The questionnaire showed that 35% of those in the study met the criteria for poor sleep health. Investigators found that those with sleep problems had a more rapid decline in brain volume or size over the course of the study than those who slept well.</p>  <p>The results were even more significant in participants over the age of 60.</p>  <p>Numerous studies have showed the importance of sleep and the effect sleep deprivation can have on our brains.

""Poor sleep can affect our immune systems, our cardiovascular health, weight and, of course, memories.

They matched any gene variations they found in the DNA with study participants' individual symptoms. In doing so, they found several ""gene clusters"" that appear to cause eight distinct classes of schizophrenia, according to a statement from the university .</p>  <p>""Complex diseases, such as schizophrenia, may be influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants that interact with one another in complex ways,"" the study authors wrote in their introduction.</p>  <p>""Genes don't operate by themselves,"" Dr. C. Robert Cloninger, one of the study's senior authors, explained in the statement. ""They function in concert much like an orchestra, and to understand how they're working, you have to know not just who the members of the orchestra are but how they interact.""</p>  <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects about 1% of the population, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Symptoms can vary from hallucinations to disordered speech to attention and decision-making problems.</p>  <p>Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80% of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited, the study authors say. A study published in July showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder. But scientists have had trouble identifying specific genetic variations that put people at risk.</p>  <p>The Washington University researchers looked at instances where a single unit of DNA was altered, which is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP. Then they identified 42 interactive SNP sets that significantly increased people's risk of schizophrenia, according to the study.</p>  <p>In other words, if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X, he was 70% more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Fred who didn't have that cluster of genes. In some cases, certain gene clusters were matched with close to a 100% increase in risk.</p>  <p>""In the past, scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia,"" co-author Dr. Dragan Svrakic said in the statement. ""What was missing was the idea that these genes don't act independently. They work in concert to disrupt the brain's structure and function, and that results in the illness.""</p>  <p>The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. It's similar to the way doctors use the term ""breast cancer"" to describe several different diseases that cause tumors in the breasts.</p>  <p>""Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases,"" Raison says. ""All psychiatric conditions likely share this heterogeneity.""</p>  <p>There are only so many ways that certain malfunctions in your genetic code can manifest, Raison says. There may be 10 separate gene mutations, but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms. So what's causing hallucinations in one person might be different than what's causing them in another.</p>  <p>So why are scientists trying to separate out the different schizophrenia disorders? Two reasons, Raison says: to help predict who might get schizophrenia, and to help treat it more efficiently.</p>  <p>Take, for example, pleurisy , which is a condition where the liquid around your lungs becomes inflamed. Several things can cause pleurisy, including a viral infection, pneumonia or cancer. If you have a drug that treats pneumonia, it's going to help only a certain percentage of patients with pleurisy. But if you know that your patient's pleurisy is caused by cancer, you'll find a different course of treatment.</p>  <p>The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says.</p>  <p>""In psychiatry land we're still stuck with pleurisy,"" he says. ""They're descriptions of symptoms, and we only have a vague idea of the underlying causes.""</p> "

Some were clearly dependent on opiates, he said, and others were seeking more pain medication.</p>  <p>""And of course we saw the complications, too,"" Lambert noted. Those complications included symptoms of severe drug withdrawal and overdoses.</p>  <p>The Medical Board of California, and eventually the Drug Enforcement Administration, were called to investigate. That investigation resulted in a laundry list of charges against Diaz including the over-prescription of narcotics, prescribing narcotics when there was no medical need, and illegal distribution of a narcotic to a person under the age of 21.</p>  <p>According to the DEA, there were a dozen overdose deaths associated with Diaz. Twenty-seven-year-old Adam Montgomery was one of them.</p>  <p>Montgomery started seeing Diaz after he injured his back on a construction job. He was seeking pain medication. He got it, and soon he was hooked.</p>  <p>As the months went by, Montgomery's parents noticed a change.</p>  <p>""Well, at some point, he started spending a lot of time in bed.

""I wanted to know why he was giving him so many."" He says he never got an answer.</p>  <p>In an affidavit, the DEA alleges that in the six weeks before Adam Montgomery's death, Diaz prescribed him a total of 2,087 pills, an average of 63 pills a day.</p>  <p>On the day after Thanksgiving in 2011, Montgomery received the news that his son had died of a drug overdose. In Adam Montgomery's bedroom and car, investigators found bottles of multiple drugs, and some were empty. All were prescribed by Diaz.</p>  <p>The autopsy concluded that a cocktail of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and methadone was the cause of death.</p>  <p>""Right now we have more people that are dying from prescription opioids than cocaine and heroin combined,"" said Robert Hill, a DEA special agent with years of experience on the front lines of the war on drugs.</p>  <p>Hill says that in 2011, the most recent year for which there are statistics, more than 22,000 people died from prescription drugs.</p>  <p>Late last year, Diaz signed a plea agreement, admitting to a reduced number of charges. Those charges include the illegal distribution of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and fentanyl.

Bülthoff -- one of the leading researchers on the 'MyCopter' project -- it's a serious question.</p>  <p>Making an idiot-proof flying car that anyone can pilot has involved years of painstaking research and may be the secret to the long-held dream of firing up the rotors, levitating and simply flying out of the bumper-to-bumper grind.</p>  <p>Now the European Union wants to make the dream a reality, researching the feasibility of small commuter air vehicles to ease the world's traffic congestion.</p>  <p>""It's been a dream of mine since I read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid, but science fiction is becoming the reality these days,"" says Dr. Bülthoff, director of perception, cognition and action at the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen, Germany.</p>  <p>Under the four-year project, the EU has drawn together six institutes from across Europe to look at the problems associated with commuting in personal aviation vehicles (PAVs). At the center of the research is a focus, not so much on building the vehicle, but on all the issues and challenges surrounding commuter aviation.</p>  <p>In the case of his institute, it's how to make the machine accessible to ordinary drivers.</p>  <p>A flying car for everybody</p>  <p>""There's no intention with this project to actually build the system,"" explains Dr.Bülthoff whose research is part of a 2007 EU report called ""Out of the Box: Ideas About the Future of Air Transport"". ""They said to us 'please, not another proposal for a flying vehicle' - we have received so many - there are so many other issues to address,"" he said.</p>  <p>These challenges involve setting up ""virtual corridor"" traffic systems in the sky that guide PAVs under existing aircraft, using advances in swarm technology to stop them crashing into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers.</p>  <p>""If you want to make a flying car it should be for everybody, but you can't make every car driver into a pilot,"" he said. ""The idea is to fly in uncontrolled airspace without interfering with all the other aircraft.""</p>  <p>He said the plan is to make the flying vehicles so intelligent, they communicate with each other and avoid collisions without any human input.</p>  <p>Keeping it simple</p>  <p>His institute, in particular, is focused on the problems of the human-machine interface: creating a design that reduces the withering array of dials and monitors in a helicopter or plane into a few simple controls on a dashboard.</p>  <p>Keeping the simple steering wheel on a flying vehicle -- where controls must make adjustments for traveling through three rather than two dimensions -- has been just one of the challenges of the project.</p>  <p>""For more than 100 years cars have used the steering wheel. It was a good idea for cars, but if you make the transition to the air why should a driver learn something completely new?"" he said.</p>  <p>Pilotless planes</p>  <p>The aircraft would be largely autonomous and would, for the most part, need no piloting at all. Flying through ""highways in the sky"" - flight paths designed to host swarms of PAVs flying in formation - the PAVs would avoid obstacles and select landing spots autonomously by using intelligent sight sensors.</p>  <p>The controls would be shared between the pilot and the machine allowing for what researchers call ""comprehensive situational awareness."" So-called ""haptic"" controls that put a feeling of resistance in the steering wheel would allow drivers to know when they were edging towards the confines of the ""highway in the sky"".</p>  <p>Other aspects of the study have looked at the social impact of PAVs as the commuter vehicle of the future.</p>  <p>""Many people might ask whether we really want thousands of these things buzzing around in the sky,"" Dr Bülthoff said.</p>  <p>Researchers have been looking at ways of constructing PAV flight paths above existing freeways and roads to minimize the environmental impact, keeping the flight ceiling at 50 meters to avoid commercial aircraft.</p>  <p>While flying time is relatively short due to the constraints of battery life using current technology, researchers on the project had found that 90 percent of commuter trips were shorter than 25 km (15 miles) and averaged about 30 minutes with peak hour delays of about 15 minutes, making a PAV perfect for short hop journeys from work to home.</p>  <p>Google holds open the door</p>  <p>Dr Bülthoff said recent advances, and social acceptance of, Google's driverless car had given real hope to researchers on the project.</p>  <p>""That really makes me very optimistic,"" he said. ""The car industry has been producing the same basic model of automobile for more than 100 years. Google is doing something that is making the car industry wake up.

Bülthoff -- one of the leading researchers on the 'MyCopter' project -- it's a serious question.</p>  <p>Making an idiot-proof flying car that anyone can pilot has involved years of painstaking research and may be the secret to the long-held dream of firing up the rotors, levitating and simply flying out of the bumper-to-bumper grind.</p>  <p>Now the European Union wants to make the dream a reality, researching the feasibility of small commuter air vehicles to ease the world's traffic congestion.</p>  <p>""It's been a dream of mine since I read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid, but science fiction is becoming the reality these days,"" says Dr. Bülthoff, director of perception, cognition and action at the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen, Germany.</p>  <p>Under the four-year project, the EU has drawn together six institutes from across Europe to look at the problems associated with commuting in personal aviation vehicles (PAVs). At the center of the research is a focus, not so much on building the vehicle, but on all the issues and challenges surrounding commuter aviation.</p>  <p>In the case of his institute, it's how to make the machine accessible to ordinary drivers.</p>  <p>A flying car for everybody</p>  <p>""There's no intention with this project to actually build the system,"" explains Dr.Bülthoff whose research is part of a 2007 EU report called ""Out of the Box: Ideas About the Future of Air Transport"". ""They said to us 'please, not another proposal for a flying vehicle' - we have received so many - there are so many other issues to address,"" he said.</p>  <p>These challenges involve setting up ""virtual corridor"" traffic systems in the sky that guide PAVs under existing aircraft, using advances in swarm technology to stop them crashing into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers.</p>  <p>""If you want to make a flying car it should be for everybody, but you can't make every car driver into a pilot,"" he said. ""The idea is to fly in uncontrolled airspace without interfering with all the other aircraft.""</p>  <p>He said the plan is to make the flying vehicles so intelligent, they communicate with each other and avoid collisions without any human input.</p>  <p>Keeping it simple</p>  <p>His institute, in particular, is focused on the problems of the human-machine interface: creating a design that reduces the withering array of dials and monitors in a helicopter or plane into a few simple controls on a dashboard.</p>  <p>Keeping the simple steering wheel on a flying vehicle -- where controls must make adjustments for traveling through three rather than two dimensions -- has been just one of the challenges of the project.</p>  <p>""For more than 100 years cars have used the steering wheel. It was a good idea for cars, but if you make the transition to the air why should a driver learn something completely new?"" he said.</p>  <p>Pilotless planes</p>  <p>The aircraft would be largely autonomous and would, for the most part, need no piloting at all. Flying through ""highways in the sky"" - flight paths designed to host swarms of PAVs flying in formation - the PAVs would avoid obstacles and select landing spots autonomously by using intelligent sight sensors.</p>  <p>The controls would be shared between the pilot and the machine allowing for what researchers call ""comprehensive situational awareness."" So-called ""haptic"" controls that put a feeling of resistance in the steering wheel would allow drivers to know when they were edging towards the confines of the ""highway in the sky"".</p>  <p>Other aspects of the study have looked at the social impact of PAVs as the commuter vehicle of the future.</p>  <p>""Many people might ask whether we really want thousands of these things buzzing around in the sky,"" Dr Bülthoff said.</p>  <p>Researchers have been looking at ways of constructing PAV flight paths above existing freeways and roads to minimize the environmental impact, keeping the flight ceiling at 50 meters to avoid commercial aircraft.</p>  <p>While flying time is relatively short due to the constraints of battery life using current technology, researchers on the project had found that 90 percent of commuter trips were shorter than 25 km (15 miles) and averaged about 30 minutes with peak hour delays of about 15 minutes, making a PAV perfect for short hop journeys from work to home.</p>  <p>Google holds open the door</p>  <p>Dr Bülthoff said recent advances, and social acceptance of, Google's driverless car had given real hope to researchers on the project.</p>  <p>""That really makes me very optimistic,"" he said. ""The car industry has been producing the same basic model of automobile for more than 100 years. Google is doing something that is making the car industry wake up. I would never have expected that several states in the United States have legalized autonomous driving, for example.""</p>  <p>""Even so, there are many issues still to be examined. Legally, for instance, if there's no driver we don't know who's responsible in case of a crash. These questions still need to be answered.""</p>  <p>While the driverless car is now a reality, he says it might be some time yet before anyone can walk into a dealership and buy a personal aviation vehicle.</p>  <p>""The timescale is to have them available by 2050,"" says Dr Bülthoff.

Startups are already popping up with different takes on design, uses and price.</p>  <p>The latest aerial offering is the PlexiDrone by DreamQii , a midrange drone for photographers who don't want to mess around with additional complicated technology. White and unremarkable-looking, the PlexiDrone is simple to put together -- just snap in the four propellers and two pieces of landing gear. It can hold a GoPro, the drone photographer's camera of choice because of its light weight, or other lightweight cameras and camcorders.</p>  <p>""This is not designed to be a toy; this is a tool for the average person to use,"" said Klever Freire, founder of PlexiDrone, who showed off his creation last week in, yes, a coffee shop in Brooklyn.</p>  <p>The consumer drone market is still wide open for newcomers due to a combination of tangled Federal Aviation Administration restrictions, high price tags, privacy concerns and a bad reputation.</p>  <p>Airborne photography is the most popular consumer use for drones, and the Phantom line from DJI currently dominates that field. DreamQii wants to take on the slick white and red Phantom drones with a slightly less expensive design and some quirky features.</p>  <p>The PlexiDrone's landing gear can be pulled up in flight so that a camera is able to capture a true 360-degree view without obstructions. Pilots can control the device from a smartphone or tablet, pointing to any direction on a map to set a route. The apps can also control the camera position and track flight hours.</p>  <p>When it's not flying, the PlexiDrone is programmed to speak when turned on but not in the air. It spits out a mixture of warnings (such as your GPS is offline), explanations and casual chitchat in a British accent or voice of your choosing.</p>  <p>""Sometimes it has a little bit of a dry wit and sometimes it has more of a sarcastic sense of humor,"" Freire said .</p>  <p>The FAA is slowly working on clearing commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, for use. (It's expected to announce details by the end of this year.) Last week, the agency issued an exemption that will allow a handful of TV and movie companies to capture aerial footage with drones, but regular people are still on a short leash.</p>  <p>So to help consumers stay out of trouble, the PlexiDrone is also programmed to obey the law.</p>  <p>Amateur drone users can't go above 400 feet, and the devices can't be used for commercial purposes without express permission. PlexiDrone limits use of the device accordingly.</p>  <p>Like many UAV entrepreneurs, Freire comes from an aerospace background. He worked for Bombardier Aerospace, the company that makes Learjets, for six years. DreamQii now has seven employees, mostly aerospace engineers and one biomedical engineer. At its 800-square-foot office in Toronto, the company prints out drone prototypes on industrial-grade 3-D printers and tests them in a 10-by-10-foot cage.</p>  <p>On Wednesday, it kicked off an IndyGoGo campaign to get attention and funds for the first run of 1,000 drones. These early devices go for $480 to $1,200 and are scheduled to ship in early 2015. Freire said the PlexiDrone will cost between $800 and $1,700 when it becomes more widely available after the first run.</p>  <p>The PlexiDrone is meant primarily for photographers, but Freire said he hopes to find other uses.</p>  <p>""We're working with a researcher who wants to create a metal detection halo.

In 2006, it came up with some rules for what is and is not a planet. The group decided Pluto didn't make the grade .</p>  <p>It was demoted to a dwarf planet, leaving our solar system with just eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</p>  <p>The union says a planet is a celestial body (PDF) that:</p>  <p>1. Orbits the sun 2. Is round or nearly round 3. Has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit</p>  <p>Pluto orbits the sun, and it's round. It got kicked out as a planet because of rule No. 3: The astronomical union said Pluto was too small to knock other space rocks out of its path as it orbits the sun.</p>  <p>But the group's definitions -- and the public's attachment to tiny Pluto -- sparked lots of debate. On September 18, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics jumped into the debate : What is a planet? It had some experts discuss the definition of a planet and then let the audience vote. Guess what? They voted that Pluto is a planet .</p>  <p>One person who never accepted Pluto's demotion is Alan Stern, principal investigator for the New Horizons spacecraft , the first spacecraft sent to Pluto. He said Pluto was given the boot because of its distance from the sun.</p>  <p>""In fact, if you put Earth where Pluto is, it would be excluded!"" Stern said. ""Any definition of planethood that excludes Earth, in any circumstance, is deeply flawed. After all, if there is any object everyone agrees is a planet, it's Earth.""</p>  <p>And he agrees with those in the audience at that Harvard panel discussion.</p>  <p>""I think the public is better suited to this than astronomers, at least,"" Stern said. ""The IAU should never have pretended to have the expertise to enter into this debate. It's a matter for planetary scientists, not astronomers.""</p>  <p>Don't forget that the other eight planets also have their differences: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are rocky; Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants.</p>  <p>""This is really about a revolution in planetary science,"" Stern said.

Facebook even created a help page just to say this : ""Facebook is a free site and will never require that you pay to continue using the site.""</p>  <p>The page then goes on to explain that, yes, you may pay money for some games and other apps you play on the site. And if you go over your mobile phone's data limit while using Facebook, you'll have to pay for that, too.</p>  <p>That still too vague for you? Maybe leaves a little too much wiggle room? Well, then, let's try this entry under Common Myths About Facebook.</p>  <p>Question: Will Facebook ever charge for service?</p>  <p>Answers: No. We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.</p>  <p>When contacted, a Facebook spokeswoman simply pointed to those two entries instead of providing a response. We're guessing if someone had to answer this question for Facebook every time it came up, it would be a full-time job.</p>  <p>Obamacare and Ebola coverage</p>  <p>There's no reason to think your health insurance would treat a case of Ebola any differently than it would any other illness because of Obamacare. But a false viral story making the rounds may have some people convinced otherwise.</p>  <p>And, for that, we can thank National Report .</p>  <p>That was where the most recent ""pay for Facebook"" story originated, and it's where this doozy comes from, too.</p>  <p>National Report is a satire site, though it's sometimes hard to tell if you just breeze through the headline and first few sentences of a story.</p>  <p>We all know The Onion is fake news. (Well, almost all of us , anyway). But sites such as National Report and The Daily Currant aren't so well-known or, for that matter, nearly as funny.</p>  <p>In fact, the more cynical among us may think these sites are intentionally trying to drive traffic by pushing out seemingly real stories about hot topics.</p>  <p>You know ... like how a controversial government policy addresses an unprecedented and frightening, if isolated, disease outbreak.</p>  <p>NBA, NFL, Congress ... or none of the above?</p>  <p>If you like football and you hate Congress, well, welcome to 97% of the population of the United States. (Full disclosure: We made up that statistic.)</p>  <p>But if you responded to the NFL's recent off-the-field troubles by sharing a post that shows that our lawmakers are bigger lawbreakers than our football stars, you fell for a fake.</p>  <p>The good people at Snopes, the Web's BS meter since 1995, are all over this one , as is PolitiFact.</p>  <p>The so-called statistics -- 36 members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse, three have been in jail for assault, 84 were arrested for drunk driving in a single year -- change from version to version. But these figures all go back to a 1999 online article that provided no source for its statistics and named none of the supposedly corrupt members of Congress.</p>  <p>Under scrutiny, it was later retracted.</p>  <p>Sorry, Pluto's still not a planet</p>  <p>But some smart people say it should be . So there's that.</p>  <p>Space geeks everywhere were saddened in 2006 when Pluto lost its status as our solar system's ninth planet.</p>  <p>So you can forgive them, perhaps for jumping the gun on social media when news appeared to hit recently that the tiny, chilly chunk of rock has been restored to its rightful place.</p>  <p>Call this one a combination of enthusiasm, confusion and exaggeration.</p>  <p>What actually happened was that the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics held a September 18 debate on whether Pluto should be restored to its full glory and four days later released the results of a vote by the audience.</p>  <p>Pluto won.</p>  <p>But in reporting that event, which has no official influence, many blogs and news sites appeared to go a bit too far, at least with their headlines.</p>  <p>""The People Have Voted: Pluto is a Planet!"" Time blared. ""Pluto Is a Planet Again, According to Harvard Astronomers,"" another blog announced.</p>  <p>So you can see how some of us who grew up with ""Interplanet Janet"" rushed to the incorrect conclusion that we have ""nine planets large and small"" again.</p>  <p>Don't microwave your iPhone</p>  <p>Thanks, 4chan!</p>  <p>When Apple's iOS 8, the new operating system for mobile devices such as its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, rolled out this month, some of the online message board's notorious pranksters greeted it by crafting a fake ad for a new service.</p>  <p>Wave , according to what we have to admit was a pretty authentic looking ad done in Apple's trademark style, is a feature that ""allows your device to be charged wirelessly through microwave frequencies.""</p>  <p>Just pop your phone in the microwave, and the battery will be all charged up.</p>  <p>We'd like to believe no one actually fell for this one.

And of course, according to (pseudo-scholars of) the Mayan calendar, we're a mere week away from The End of the World.</p>  <p>All that finality got us thinking about how folks really manage to lose their netiquette heads when they scramble, legs flailing and akimbo, toward the denouement of events and life chapters. So here is the ultimate (get it?) guide to a polite big finish.</p>  <p>If you're leaving your job ...</p>  <p>Generally, it's wise to wait until your last day or so to let the LOLcat out of the bag (which is to say, to tweet or blog or otherwise post about your new gig).</p>  <p>Why? Because until the ink has dried on your contract, you don't want to run your mouth and risk sharing an update your new company wanted to announce itself. Plus, your current employer might not want to be hit with a torrent of resumes. Remember to give your professional contacts your new e-mail address before your account is shut down.</p>  <p>Then social-media up a storm on your first day or after your first week gushing about how much you love your new gig. Just don't do it during business hours. Obviously.</p>  <p>If you're leaving a city ...</p>  <p>The most heartfelt farewells will happen in person, but you do need to let your more casual acquaintances know about the relocation.</p>  <p>A mass e-mail is wise, as are a few Paul Revere-esque ""Moving day is coming! Moving day is coming!"" updates on your social networking site of choice.</p>  <p>But brace yourself: You'll likely continue to receive mass digital invites to events and debauchery in your former city from well-meaning but clueless contacts. Calmly write back to the inviter, explain that you won't be attending because you're flipping 2,000 miles away, and ask to be taken off the attendant chain of e-mails/texts/Facebook messages.</p>  <p>If your company goes kaput ...</p>  <p>The unemployment rate may have ticked down, but bankruptcies and shut-downs are still rampant (co-columnist Andi's magazine, ""Martha Stewart's Whole Living,"" was shuttered on Friday , in fact).</p>  <p>Stay classy to aid your job search and keep the bridges behind you unburned. Wait until the employer has made official statements to the press (don't blow the lid off the thing sooner), and then use whatever outlets you have to spread the word that you're back on the market. (Hi there!)</p>  <p>(Hey, we couldn't very well call ourselves Netiquette experts if we weren't big on the Art of Self-Promotion , right?)</p>  <p>If you're leaving your wife ...</p>  <p>Digital missives should not, we repeat, should not be involved in the actual dumping. It's an obvious warning that more than a third of adults bewilderingly ignore .</p>  <p>Suck it up and place a phone call or discuss it in person. Then let your close friends or parents or whomever know about the break-up (we recommend using e-mail or the phone) before you go switching up your relationship status on Facebook (or worse, creating an online dating profile).</p>  <p>You don't want your loved ones to call you in alarm after a stalk-y friend alerts them to your new Single status, do you?</p>  <p>If you're hanging up your hat as Netiquette columnists ...</p>  <p>You take a bow and move on.</p>  <p>These last 2.5+ years (and 130+ columns) have been real, and we're legit grateful to the readers and fans who responded with balanced criticism, intelligent questions and positive feedback.</p>  <p>We've enjoyed mouthing off and calling out netiquette breaches as we saw 'em, and hope you've picked up a pointer or two. But we're moving on with our writing lives -- Brenna with a YA novel, Andi with a screenplay -- and we thought it wise to tap out before the world comes to a smoldering end.</p>  <p>And to all the haters: Good luck with your lives as well as basic motor tasks. You desperately need it.</p>  <p>-- Andi & Brenna</p> "

We can hear the shouty, complainy e-mails already.)</p>  <p>""The secret of a full life is to live and relate to others as if they might not be there tomorrow, as if you might not be there tomorrow. ... This thought has made me more and more attentive to all encounters, meetings, introductions, which might contain the seed of depth that might be carelessly overlooked.</p>  <p>""This feeling has become a rarity, and rarer every day now that we have reached a hastier and more superficial rhythm, now that we believe we are in touch with a greater amount of people, more people, more countries. This is the illusion which might cheat us of being in touch deeply with the one breathing next to us. The dangerous time when mechanical voices, radios, telephones, take the place of human intimacies, and the concept of being in touch with millions brings a greater and greater poverty in intimacy and human vision.""</p>  <p>Nin wrote those words in 1946, but she might as well have been writing them today. She starts with a YOLO and ends with a contemporary-sounding rumination of just how horrible we've all become now that we hold the power to be in touch with millions of people in the palms of our hands.</p>  <p>That's right, we're talking about how annoying and rude and antisocial we've all become with our smartphones and tablets. As CNN investigates all the ways mobile devices are changing our lives, we'd like to peel our eyes off our glowing screens long enough to recount our top eight egregious handheld errors.</p>  <p>These are things you literally could not do before the www went mobile; now we're embarrassing ourselves all over the place. Please stop:</p>  <p>1. Drunk -tweeting, -texting, -Instagramming, etc.</p>  <p>Long gone are the days when the only witnesses to your inebriated ramblings were other bar patrons who also saw you stumble from your bar stool to the ground. Whether you're able to keep it together with spelling and syntax (in which case, you've just got the world going, ""Wait, she wants to do WHAT to Paul Ryan?!""), or your typing skills erode quickly, alcohol and mobile devices don't mix .</p>  <p>2. Fooling around on your phone whenever you have a spare moment.</p>  <p>As writer Austin Kleon writes in his alarmingly cute book, ""Steal Like an Artist,"" we need unstructured time for creativity to foster, down time in which we mess around and let our disconnected thoughts gel into cool ideas.</p>  <p>If you turn every spare moment (a red light, a line at the salad station, a ride in the elevator) into an excuse to check your Cinemagram feed , you just won't have those artistic a ha! moments. (And no, ""Draw Something"" doesn't count.)</p>  <p>3. Passive-aggressively whining for the whole world to see.</p>  <p>Look, we all have our personal stock of First World Problems, frustrated complaints with the minor injustices committed by a cruel, uncaring world. That's been true since the dawn of time. Now we just have myriad means of expressing them.</p>  <p>Nobody cares about your thinly veiled railings against your ex or roommate or employer , OK? Unless you've scribbled it on a notepad , in which case you should share it with the world. So that we can laugh at you.</p>  <p>4. Being really, really scared to actually use the phone.</p>  <p>Phones and tablets have made it oh so easy to communicate without using our voiceboxes. This is bad for relationships for oh so many reasons . Anais Nin would just hate it. Hit ""dial"" and enjoy the time-honored pas de deux of two humans, you know, talking.</p>  <p>5. Missing your favorite band's concert because you're so busy taking crappy photos, letting your phone ring and fiddling with your phone during the set.</p>  <p>Your hard-of-hearing, reformed punk-rock uncle was right: Concerts really WERE better back in the day, not necessarily because music really meant something, man, but because the audience actually paid attention and sang along and danced instead of holding their phones in the air and spending 30-plus seconds trying to find the shutter button on the front of the screen .</p>  <p>Your punkle would be so disappointed if he still made it out to shows today.</p>  <p>6. Texting salacious pictures.</p>  <p>The ritual sharing of NC-17 photos used to be a complicated analog affair involving Polaroids and furtive looks. Nowadays, people just drop trou, snap and send . Analyze THAT, Anais Nin.</p>  <p>7. Turning your friends into enemies with videos of them.</p>  <p>Camcorders have become tiny and discreet and as user-friendly as checking your e-mail. This is potentially bad news for those people you hang out with, as you hold in your hands a recording device that can humiliate them forever .</p>  <p>Set ground rules and roll the camera judiciously, lest you wind up publicly shaming a friend for her foul mouth, caught-on-film fart or unpopular political opinions.</p>  <p>8. Letting your seething anger leach out into the world at large.</p>  <p>Humans have always done stupid things when they're emotionally riled up. Now, those tantrums and rages and outbursts are shared and cached for the world to see . Take a deep breath and put down the smartphone.</p>  <p>9. Texting while walking.</p>  <p>Rarely does this go well . Whatever's so urgent can probably wait a few minutes. Or you can, you know, actually call the person (see No. 4).</p>  <p>10. Using your phone in the bathroom.</p>  <p>Don't. Just don't.</p> "
"330","Five texts you should never send","CNN.com","2012-08-27 19:53:26","2014-10-06 06:23:14","http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/22/tech/web/netiquette-terrible-texts/index.html","Technology"," <p>That's a conclusion cobbled together from the Pew Internet and American Life Project , which found that the median number of texts adults send and receive in a day doubled from 2009 to 2010, and much anecdotal observation from the authors.</p>  <p>Read on to learn just how terrible silent cell phone users are these days, and the five texts that should never traverse that satellite-banked arc from your hands to the eyes of another.</p>  <p>1. ""I think we should see other people.""</p>  <p>It isn't just skittish teenagers pulling this rude move. Last year, a survey from Lab 42 found that 33% of adults (adults!) had broken up with someone via text, e-mail or Facebook. Forty percent said they ""would ever"" do it, indicating that 7% of the surveyed humans are soulless jerks who haven't but would hurtfully sever ties with a lover if only someone would respond to their advances.</p>  <p>Yes, breaking up is hard. Knowing you're going to hurt someone you cared about with your words indeed makes your stomach do some Cirque de Soleil-esque acrobatics. But shooting over a one-way missive to deliver the news for you? It's supremely cruel, because it leaves the other person cocking his or her head with Fred Willard-esque histrionics and asking, ""Hey, wha' happened?"" That complete lack of closure (not to mention the dearth of soothing, I-care-about-you-as-a-human-being signals you send with your voice and motions) add up to WAY more ruminating than is necessary.</p>  <p>Netiquette: Be careful when diagnosing your ailments online</p>  <p>The break-up text is only this much more noble than ghosting on someone you're dating, letting the silences grow longer and longer until you can tell yourself it was a mutual separation and then scuttle into the night like a cowardly cockroach. If you went on enough dates to call this person your boyfriend or girlfriend, he or she deserves at least a call.</p>  <p>2. ""Will you marry me?""</p>  <p>A text proposal. It actually happened, people. And if that isn't innards-wrenchingly horrific enough, after it happened, Miss Manners went on to condone it . Can we please consider marriage proposals one of the few remaining bastions of old-fashioned romance, free from the lackadaisical pall that technology has cast over everything?</p>  <p>Unless you've rigged some clever feat that ties in the nerdy way you met, your phone should be put away, your knee should be on the pavement, and your hands should be clutching a ring, not picking a ringtone.</p>  <p>3. ""We're thinking about going to Shortstop later but Aiden is still napping & Mona was talking abt having ppl over for a cookout. IDK if I want to be out in the heat tho since I'm still hungo from Bosco's pirate party thing last night. Are you and Weeds still... [1 of 2]""</p>  <p>4. ""...wandering around the park or did you want to do something later? Hit me up if you see this before 10. Gonna go pass out for a while. [2 of 2]""</p>  <p>Texting was supposed to save us time by letting us bypass the phone call and just instantly telegraph the important stuff. But we've grown so reliant upon it that we obliviously miss, Mr. Bean-like, the conversations that could happen expeditiously over the phone.</p>  <p>Netiquette: An open letter to texting-crazed teens</p>  <p>So often, we put our thumbs to work typing out long and convoluted messages that warrant a detailed, meticulous volley of responses, when wagging our tongues would have cleared things up in 30 seconds flat. More than half of texters have ""long, personal text message exchanges,"" according to a 2010 survey . They are all wasting time.</p>  <p>Our rule of (red, raw, overused) thumb: If your text is longer than two sentences and it demands a response other than a simple yes or no, just hit Call. You'll save everyone a little time and a lot of confusion.</p>  <p>5. [a photo of your junk]</p>  <p>According to a Pew Research Center study that is ( according to the Times ) due out later this year, 6% of American adults -- that's one in 17 upstanding citizens -- has sent a nude or nearly nude (but not ""never-nude"" ) photo on a cell phone. And 15% have received such a text. (Apparently these self-portraitists are prolific.)</p>  <p>Leave something to the imagination, folks.</p>  <p>Netiquette: Five ways to annoy people on Twitter</p> "

You're coming of age having never known an Internet-free existence. You'll never know what it's like to phone a friend at 10:01 p.m. and politely ask if it's too late to call, or to bike to a neighbor's and ring his doorbell with no preconceived notions of his whereabouts.</p>  <p>You won't understand what it's like to have to yell for your dad to come to the basement to settle the argument over whether a loofah is an animal or a plant or whether one could, in theory, set one's farts on fire. The humor of the scene in ""Clueless"" where Cher and Dionne find each other in the high school hallway, mid-cell phone conversation, is probably lost on you. You haven't even seen ""Clueless."" We understand.</p>  <p>While we can't really imagine our adolescence playing out so heavily on pixelated screens, we're able to sympathize. That's why our pleas to you come from a place of wisdom and concern, not of outdated notions or clinging vice-like to the past.</p>  <p>Really, we older humans (fully aware that you find 93% of us very to extremely annoying) just don't want you to miss out on the vivid colors and poignant moments and slow-burn stories of the next seven decades of your existence. (That, and we're terrified you're going to make us obsolete as soon as you hit the job market.)</p>  <p>With that place of loving care in mind, we give you our pleas.</p>  <p>Stop sexting</p>  <p>By its broadest definition -- sending explicit texts -- about half of 18- to 24-year-olds are doing it, according to recent research from the University of Michigan . And 28% of teenagers are texting fully nude photos of themselves, according to another new report . But, to quote every mother of a teenager ever, ""If everyone else jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?""</p>  <p>Seriously, those 28% of people are dumb. They're risking public humiliation should they later realize they want to own a company or run for office (cough, cough, way too many male politicos, cough), and what's more, their digital dalliances may meet the legal definition of child pornography .</p>  <p>Plus, anyone (teachers, parents, principals) nearby can read a new text when it pops up on your smartphone -- how mortified will you be when your boyfriend leaves his phone on the kitchen counter? Play it safe and text in sweet-sounding code words only.</p>  <p>Stop texting so much</p>  <p>In 2010, the average teen was sending more than 3,000 texts a month, according to a study from Nielsen . Three. Thousand. That's 3,000 moments when you've got your head ducked away from your surroundings, fingers flailing, tongue protruding from the lower right side of your mouth ever so slightly, sending someone an obviously inane missive when you could be just interacting with the people (or nature or cityscape or whatever) around you.</p>  <p>It may feel natural, but when you're around anyone over 25, in particular, it comes off as very, very rude. Nobody enjoys being put on hold while the person 3 feet away from him or her taps all over a screen. And when the tapping goes on for hours on a 45-second loop, in response to every ding of a response?</p>  <p>We promise, if you text your friend back just once to say you can't talk right now, no one will spontaneously implode. If anything, your bud's call-used finger pads will appreciate the much-needed break.</p>  <p>Get over your fear of the phone</p>  <p>Our parents couldn't believe how much time we spent on the phone in the early 2000s, lounging on pink carpet and twirling the phone's cord while parsing exactly what Darren meant by writing his and Janice's initials as the points on the vector on the chalkboard in geometry class. It probably seemed like a colossal waste of time, moments we should have spent doing homework while wearing our dental headgear or something.</p>  <p>But voice-to-voice communication is becoming a lost art, and that's kind of a huge bummer.</p>  <p>Nowadays, just 14% of teens say they talk daily with friends on a landline, down from 30% in 2009. And 31% of teens say they never talk on a landline with friends. Similarly, 26% of teens say they talk daily with friends on their cell phone, down from 38% of teens in 2009, according to the Pew Research Center .</p>  <p>(And, yes, the amount of time that adults spend on the phone overall is probably declining too, thanks to wondrous inventions such as Seamless and ZocDoc that prevent us from actually having to deal with other human beings. But these are teens -- gabby, detail-obsessed beings with the intricate social structure of a clan of bonobos, who can spend seven hours together at school and still find material to cover in a four-hour phone conversation in the evening.)</p>  <p>As we've said before , the phone offers unparalleled access to the thoughts and feelings of the person on the other end of the line. Only over the phone can you pick up on nuance, soothe a spurned friend appropriately and really get to the heart of why that beezy Jocelyn asked Greg to Turnabout when everyone knew you were planning to.</p>  <p>We also worry that your not using the phone means you're going to be jerks when you get into the office world, adding to our bursting inboxes instead of picking up the damn phone every now and then. Our end goals may be selfish, but we want the best for everyone. Even ADD-addled, lightning-fingered, know-it-all you.</p> "

But there's also a serious side to the astronauts' sojourns among the stars that we don't often hear about.</p>  <p>""We are bettering the human experience on Earth. Going further, going beyond,"" says Stephanie Buskirk Dudley, an ISS payload operations director (POD) who helps coordinate all the research conducted at the facility. ""We learn things by doing science that we never even knew we would learn. And it's actually because we are there.""</p>  <p>If the ISS is a crazy space circus, then Buskirk Dudley is one of the ringmasters leading the ever-changing scientific troupe.</p>  <p>She explains: ""We've got cameras looking at all over the Earth from the space station that are helping with disaster research and coastal erosion. We have one coming for ocean temperature and warming of the oceans. We are doing research that affects every single person on the planet.""</p>  <p>Science among the stars</p>  <p>It became humanity's home away from home in October 2000 when the first six astronauts arrived on board and the ISS has been busy ever since. The permanently orbiting facility -- which has cost an estimated €100 billion (just under $135 billion) according to the European Space Agency -- has since been inhabited constantly by astronauts as they work tirelessly to answer some of science's most intriguing questions.</p>  <p>Often we see some of the more entertaining demonstrations appear on social media. Just last month U.S. astronaut Reid Wiseman uploaded the world's first #SpaceVine of a spectacular fireball experiment called FLEX-2 , which examines how fuel ignites in space. Here on Earth, we thought it looked pretty cool. For scientists, the results could yield new insights into fuel efficiency for engines on Earth and safer future spacecraft production.</p>  <p>Another seemingly quirky experiment involves sending 40 mice up to the station later this year, which will be their home for six months -- roughly a quarter of a mouse's average lifespan. The rodents' journey to space may look like an odd move for scientists but it is hoped the ""moustronauts"" will provide valuable biomedical insight into how spaceflight affects the human body.</p>  <p>These are just some of the hundreds of investigations taking place every day aboard the floating outpost by scientists from all around the world. The mammoth task is coordinated by the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.</p>  <p>Buskirk Dudley is one of 23 certified PODs who plan every minute detail involving space station research. Pioneering research is conducted 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and the key to success is planning, she says. ""[It takes] a great team of people doing many different jobs. Everybody is an expert in their own little field. It really takes a whole team with a lot of hard work and planning.</p>  <p>""We've got, for instance, ultrasound on board the station and we have perfected training non-medical personnel -- astronauts -- to perform on themselves and get good results for doctors on Earth. And that is directly applicable to countries in which medicine is not as available as it is in the U.S. and the UK.""</p>  <p>The success of ultrasound experiments by non-medical personnel in space has led scientists to believe that back on Earth, patients could be trained to perform their own ultrasound exams and send the images to doctors in situations where a medical facility is difficult to access.</p>  <p>Buskirk Dudley adds: ""Over half of the population of the world, for instance, is a woman. We are doing research on bone health every single day and just that one experiment alone could help over 50% of the world's population. That is just human research: we've got biological research, we've got material research, combustion, particle physics -- the whole gamut of research we're doing every single day.</p>  <p>""Today, the crew is upgrading the 'Robonaut' (a humanoid robot on the ISS). Our eventual goal is to give him legs and have him do maintenance tasks to free up the crew for more science. When we originally flew him, he was just a torso and arms. And they are doing robot surgery to upgrade all his internal electronics so they can eventually add legs to him.""</p>  <p>'It's research for the world'</p>  <p>But Buskirk Dudley is keen to point out that it's a truly International Space Station, not simply an American enterprise. POIC is one of five international control centers working to synchronize the research at the ISS. Other similar control centers are located in Germany, Japan, Russia and, of course, back at Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>  <p>""Even though it's NASA science that we're doing, the scientists are all over the world. It's not just science in the U.S.,"" says Buskirk Dudley. ""The scientists that we work with are not at those control centers. They are in their lab, in their university, in their house perhaps -- all over the world. We've enabled them to do the science wherever they might be.""</p>  <p>Cheryl Nickerson is a professor at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University. She is one such trailblazing scientist at the forefront of cellular biomechanics, who has achieved remarkable success using the ISS to conduct unique spaceflight research into diseases such as salmonella.</p>  <p>""The microgravity environment of spaceflight offers a unique environment for ground-breaking biotechnology and biomedical innovations and discoveries to advance human health in infectious disease, cancer, aging, bone and muscle-wasting diseases, and advances in tissue engineering,"" she says.</p>  <p>""Our research demonstrated that spaceflight increased the virulence of salmonella and globally altered the gene expression of this pathogen in unique ways that are not observed using traditional experimental approaches on Earth.""</p>  <p>And she's not done there. Later this year, commercial carrier SpaceX will fly the professor's latest NASA-funded experiment, Micro-5, to the space station, where her team will monitor the salmonella infection process in real-time when the human surrogate host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to spaceflight.</p>  <p>For Nickerson, the ISS is invaluable for the ongoing pursuit of knowledge.</p>  <p>""If properly implemented, the legacy of an ISS research portfolio consisting of hypothesis-driven, impeccably designed and executed experiments will have a lasting impact on our nation's scientific capability, economy, and quality of our lives.""</p>  <p>READ: Voyager 1: 'The little spacecraft that could'</p>  <p>READ: Why solar flares aren't just fireworks in space</p>  <p>SEE: Capturing the Cosmos through a lens</p> "

It is in use at 3,000 junctions in the British capital, with a further 1,500 earmarked for SCOOT upgrades by 2018.</p>  <p>The Pedestrian SCOOT system, however, would be the first time the technology has been used as pedestrian pinch points in the capital.</p>  <p>""Our SCOOT system has been used around the world for many years use to optimize and coordinate the traffic signal junctions and we've done that currently and historically for vehicles,"" explained Mark Cracknell, team leader of the Technology Delivery Group at Transport for London.</p>  <p>""We have inductive loops in the road that detect vehicles, do clever analysis of the traffic patterns and then coordinate the junctions to try to make the progress through the city as smooth as possible.""</p>  <p>Currently pedestrians at many crossings in London get a standard six seconds to get onto the road -- known as the ""green man"" time -- before countdown technology takes over telling pedestrians how long they have left to get across the street.</p>  <p>What SCOOT technology aims to do is dynamically change that ""green man"" time.</p>  <p>""If there's only a few people waiting we'll just go for the standard six seconds to cross, but if we've got 100 people waiting to cross we can increment that up to the appropriate time.</p>  <p>""What we're avoiding is the scenario where we don't have enough time to get everybody on the crossing and then pedestrians have to wait for another cycle of the traffic signals to get across.""</p>  <p>Cracknell said the system would have the most value where the pedestrian traffic is variable, for instance outside a school or a tube station.</p>  <p>""During the day there might be a low flow and you don't want to be fixed with a high crossing time when there's no one there,"" he said. ""There are technologies out there that can detect whether a pedestrian is waiting, but the technology we use actually quantifies and counts the number of people.</p>  <p>""We're not aware that this is in use anywhere else in the world.""</p>  <p>At the heart of the technology is a stereoscopic camera that allows the sensors to detect and count crowds of people in three dimensions.</p>  <p>""They're vision-based systems, the idea being traditional vision systems just have a single camera and there are a number of inherent flaws with that -- things like shadows, puddles and changing light conditions can cause problems.</p>  <p>""The stereoscopic camera allows us to get a sense of depth -- discount the puddles and the shadows -- and just get a picture of the people standing there.""</p>  <p>Despite this it's not all one-way traffic. Pedestrians that press the button on a set of lights and then change their minds and walk away are another challenge to the free flow of traffic.</p>  <p>Transport for London is trialing new technology that would detect when a pedestrian has changed their mind and strolled off or crossed the road before the ""green man"" signal.</p>  <p>""This is what we call 'call cancel' technology and we're trialing it at different locations in London -- it's the combination of both SCOOT and 'call cancel' which we are looking at,"" said Cracknell.</p>  <p>Ultimately, however, developing technology that brings back the function of the human traffic cop is the Holy Grail for Transport for London.</p>  <p>""We're trying to be more intelligent with what we're doing. Rather than just tweaking the splits of the vehicles, we will be catering for everybody,"" Cracknell said.</p> "

But here is what we do know:</p>  <p>1. She's a well-respected attorney.</p>  <p>Alamuddin's profile on the site The Legal 500 says she ""specialises in international law, human rights, criminal law and extradition."" Some of her clients have included the Royal Court of Bahrain and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</p>  <p>""She is also part of the legal team representing the government of Cambodia in a case involving a territorial dispute with Thailand at the International Court of Justice in The Hague,"" the site says. ""She has previously worked as a legal adviser to judges at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and as senior legal adviser to the prosecutor of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.""</p>  <p>2. Clooney isn't the only one who finds her attractive.</p>  <p>She was named one of the 21 hottest female barristers in London on the blog ""Your Barrister Boyfriend.""</p>  <p>The blog states: ""Amal Alamuddin may make some feel inadequate because she has achieved the seemingly unattainable ideal of contemporary femininity: She is both breathtakingly beautiful and formidably successful.""</p>  <p>3. She's a world traveler.</p>  <p>In addition to being fluent in both Arabic and French, Alamuddin has traveled widely. Her time in the United States included graduating from the New York University School of Law, and among her trips is a safari to Tanzania she reportedly took with Clooney in March.</p>  <p>4. She's discreet.</p>  <p>Alamuddin, 36, hasn't been speaking out about her relationship with the 53-year-old star. She has not given extensive interviews and People magazine reported on their wedding based on brief comments from Clooney and guests at the ceremony.</p>  <p>5. Alamuddin must be special.</p>  <p>There's no debating this one. Clooney, who was married from 1989 until 1993 to ""No Strings Attached"" actress Talia Balsam, has long been outspoken about the fact that he has had no desire to wed again. In a recent Esquire interview, Clooney said, ""I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever,"" about becoming a husband and father. He has proved that by dating his fair share of women over the years but not settling down.</p>  <p>6. Her co-workers are happy for her.</p>  <p>Alamuddin may not be talking, but her law firm has spilled the beans. The Doughty Street law firm was clearly excited about the news and released a statement that read in part: ""The barristers and staff of Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to Ms Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr George Clooney on their engagement to be married.""</p> "

As this weekend's box office shows, audiences are far from tired of seeing this star in star vehicles, righting wrongs and dispensing justice, violently when necessary.

Ticket sales dropped by two-thirds in its sophomore weekend.</p>  <p>As for the year's top movie, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is now at $319 million and counting in domestic theaters, ranking behind only ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man 3"" among Marvel's mélange of mega-hits.</p>  <p>Domestic weekend box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co.

The pair's special relationship, combined with their storybook, leafy town and its sweetly eccentric inhabitants, made for some magical moments.</p>  <p>As edgy as it was cozy (yes, edgy!), ""Gilmore Girls"" is rubber-stamped on fans' hearts like Lorelai's would-be Mel Brooks tattoo, and Netflix couldn't have picked a better month to begin streaming. (If you've never watched ""Gilmore,"" fall is the best time to start from the beginning, since the season perfectly matches the small town charm of ""Gilmore Girls'"" Stars Hollow. You've got your pumpkins, pie, pumpkin pie, scarves, snow and always plenty of coffee.)</p>  <p>Netflix's announcement is a huge win for the die-hard fans, who will no longer have to cycle through DVDs the way Lorelai mainlines coffee. This'll be far less labor intensive, although no less time-consuming:</p>  <p>""Oh man, Netflix is going to have the entire run of 'Gilmore Girls'? This isn't going to be good for my productivity. Or my hygiene. Or my life,"" one fan tweeted .</p>  <p>"" 'Gilmore Girls' is coming to Netflix. Please don't speak to me after October 1st, I'm v busy (indefinitely),"" said another.</p>  <p>So thank you, Netflix. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p> "

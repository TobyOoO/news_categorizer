Robel Phillipos, 21, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is accused of lying to authorities about being in Tsarnaev&apos;s dorm room when two other friends removed Tsarnaev&apos;s backpack, laptop and other potential evidence three days after the deadly attack.              Opening statements are scheduled Monday in U.S. District Court, and the trial is expected to last about two weeks.              Twin bombs placed near the marathon&apos;s finish line killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on 30 federal charges and could face the death penalty if convicted.              Phillipos went to high school with Tsarnaev and they remained friends while both attended the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.              Prosecutors say Phillipos lied about his movements on the night of April 18, 2013, three days after the bombing and hours after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his brother as bombing suspects.              Lawyers for Phillipos say he was a frightened 19-year-old when he was questioned, and did not intend to mislead investigators.              Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev have been convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice for removing the items from Tsarnaev&apos;s dorm room. None of the three men is accused of participating in the bombings."

"3","Once derided as domain of slackers, video game playing now scholarship worthy, school says","Associated Press","2014-10-06 01:13:04","2014-10-06 15:19:02","http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/83VOWE9_bgo/","us","CHICAGO –  As a teenager, holed up in his bedroom, illuminated by the glow of his laptop, Youngbin Chung became addicted to video games. Ten-hours-a-day addicted.              His grades tanked. His parents fretted.              A few years later, the 20-year-old from the San Francisco area leads a team of headset-wearing players into virtual battle in a darkened room at a small private university in Chicago. He&apos;s studying computer networking there on a nearly $15,000 a year athletic scholarship —  for playing League of Legends, the video game that once jeopardized his high school diploma.              &quot;I never thought in my life I&apos;m going to get a scholarship playing a game,&quot; said Chung, one of 35 students attending Robert Morris University on the school&apos;s first-in-the-nation video game scholarship.              Once regarded as anti-social slackers or nerds in a basement, gamers have become megastars in what are now called esports. In professional leagues, they compete for millions of dollars in prizes and pull in six-figure incomes for vanquishing their enemies in what have become huge spectator events packing tens of thousands into sports stadiums around the world.              Games have evolved from the days of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong into something much more complex. They demand hyper mental acuity and involve multiple players communicating with each other in teams, plotting strategy, predicting opponents&apos; moves and reacting in milliseconds.              Robert Morris, a not-for-profit university with about 3,000 students, believes those are not so different from the skills one uses on a football field or a basketball court and that spending money to recruit these students, too, will enrich campus life and add to its ranks of high-achieving graduates.              &quot;It&apos;s coming; it&apos;s coming big time,&quot; Associate Athletic Director Kurt Melcher said of the esports trend and what he&apos;s sure is its looming recognition by a bigger chunk of the collegiate sports world.              Hundreds of other colleges and universities have esports clubs, but Robert Morris is the first to recognize it as a varsity sport under its athletic department. The scholarships, which cover up to half off tuition and half off room and board (worth a total of $19,000 in a typical three-quarter academic year) are for a single game, League of Legends, in which teams of five on five use keyboards and mouses to control mythical fighters battling it out in a science fiction-like setting.              The first practices started last month in a $100,000 classroom outfitted with an expansive video screen, computers and an array of eye-dazzling gaming paraphernalia.              The space is dimly lit and window blinds are drawn to keep glare off monitors. In the darkness, dozens of students wearing microphone headsets flit fingers and thumbs over the controls with blistering intensity and concentration. Death comes in a multitude of forms and is often sudden. Accordingly, the hum of game chatter is punctuated by the occasional whooping cry of victory or anguished sigh of defeat.              The Robert Morris Eagles will play teams in two leagues that include the likes of Harvard and MIT with hopes of making it to the League of Legends North American Collegiate Championship, where the members of the first-place team take home $30,000 each in scholarships.              Melcher dreamed up the scholarship idea while searching online for the video games he used to play.              Some soccer players were bemused, but he said there was no real pushback from the university, which already has scholarships for everything from bowling to dressing as the mascot.              Some 27 million people play League of Legends each day, according to developer Riot Games Inc.              This year&apos;s professional championship is Oct. 19 in Seoul at the stadium South Korea built to host the 2002 soccer World Cup. The 45,000 seats are expected to sell out. The top team will take home $1 million.              The traditional sports world is still trying to figure out what to make of the phenomenon.              ESPN has dabbled in esports coverage, but network President John Skipper recently declared it a non-sport.              &quot;It&apos;s not a sport,&quot; he said at a conference in New York. &quot;It&apos;s a competition, right? I mean, chess is a competition, and checkers is a competition. ... I&apos;m mostly interested in doing real sports.&quot;              Still, he added, &quot;You can&apos;t really ignore it.&quot;"

They said that their son &quot;took Islam&apos;s practices seriously, including praying the five daily prayers and taking on the name Abdul-Rahman.&quot; The Kassings also released a letter written by their 26-year-old son in which he thanked them for their strength and commitment and appeared to try to prepare them for his death.&quot;I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all,&quot; Kassig said in the letter, according to his parents. &quot;I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.&quot;Kassig was taken captive by the Islamic State group Oct. 1, 2013, in Syria, where he was providing aid for refugees fleeing that country&apos;s civil war.The group said in a video after the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning last week that Kassig would be next. The Kassigs pleaded for their son&apos;s freedom in a video statement released Saturday.The letter continues: &quot;In terms of my faith, I pray every day and I am not angry about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief.&quot;The Kassigs say the complication appears to arise from his conversion but that they see this &quot;as part our son&apos;s long spiritual journey.&quot;According to the family, Kassig formed the aid organization Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, in Turkey to provide aid and assistance to Syrian refugees. He began delivering food and medical supplies to Syrian refugee camps in 2012 and is also a trained medical assistant who provided trauma care to injured Syrian civilians and helped train 150 civilians in providing medical aid.In Saturday&apos;s video statement, Ed Kassig said his son had grown &quot;to love and admire&quot; the Syrian people, after growing up in an Indianapolis family with a long history of humanitarian work and teaching.&quot;Our son was living his life according to that same humanitarian call when he was taken captive,&quot; Ed, a teacher himself, said.Kassig served in the Army from June 2006 and September 2007. He was a member of the 75th Ranger regiment and served four months in Iraq in 2007 before being medically discharged at the rank of private first class in September of that year. The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

"7","Obama Dedicates Disabled Veterans’ Memorial in Washington","Military.com","2014-10-05 22:06:04","2014-10-06 15:19:06","http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/national/~3/lRxLOFQYnjo/","us"," (Military.com)America’s disabled veterans were honored Sunday during the dedication of a national memorial that President Obama called a reminder to the nation of what it owes to those injured and wounded in combat.  “If they come home having left a part of themselves on the battlefield, on our behalf, this memorial tells us what we must do,” Obama said. “When our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery, we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit, every single bit of care that they have earned, that they deserve.”  Called the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, the memorial now standing about 1,000 feet from the U.S. Capitol and across from the U.S. Botanic Garden was 17 years in the making, the brainstorm of Florida philanthropist Lois Pope. In 1997, Pope asked an official with the Disabled American Veterans where in Washington stood the memorial to troops injured and wounded in war.  When DAV National Adjutant Art Wilson said there was none, Pope spent the next decade helping lead the effort as co-founder of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation. Chaired by actor and longtime veterans advocate Gary Sinise, the foundation also picked up contributions from individuals, veterans groups, non-profits and corporations.    About $80 million was ultimately raised and ground was broken on the memorial in 2011.  In his remarks, Obama noted that as long as Americans have rallied to defend and fight for the country, its leaders have also at times let them down when the shooting was over. Obama alluded to George Washington’s 1783 letter to the states, in which he notes “the obligations this Country is under” to veterans waiting on promised disability pensions but who were homeless and begging in the streets.  “After the Civil War, and again after the First World War, our disabled veterans had to organize and march for the benefits they had earned,” President Obama said. “In the United States of America, those who have fought for our freedom should never be shunned and should never be forgotten.  Obama called the memorial “another step forward,” saying it commemorates “the two battles our disabled veterans have fought – the battle over there and the battle here at home. Your battle to recover, which at times can be even harder, and certainly as long.”  Obama also said Sunday that the memorial’s dedication served as a reminder of the sacrifices necessary with war.  “This memorial is a challenge to all of us, ‘a reminder of ‘the obligations this country is under’,” he said, invoking Washington’s words. “And if we are to truly honor these veterans, we must heed the voices that speak to us here. Let’s never rush into war, because it is America’s sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives.”  Americans should only be sent to fight “when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said, and if sent given “the strategy, the mission, and the support that they need to get the job done.”  -- Bryant Jordan can be reached at bryant.jordan@military.com."

In an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS&apos; &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Comey said Chinese hackers target the intellectual property of U.S. companies in China every day.              &quot;I liken them a bit to a drunk burglar. They&apos;re kickin&apos; in the front door, knocking over the vase, while they&apos;re walking out with your television set. They&apos;re just prolific. Their strategy seems to be: &apos;We&apos;ll just be everywhere all the time. And there&apos;s no way they can stop us,&apos;&quot; Comey said.              The Justice Department earlier this year announced a 31-count indictment against Chinese hackers accused of breaking into computer networks at steel companies and the manufacturers of solar and nuclear technology, with the goal of gaining a competitive advantage. China has denied the allegations.              In the CBS interview, Comey also discussed the U.S. fight against terrorism. He described the terrorist networks within Syria as a sophisticated &quot;metastasis&quot; of al-Qaida.              He said the Khorasan Group, an al-Qaida cell in Syria that was targeted in military strikes last month, was &quot;working and, you know, may still be working on an effort to attack the United States or our allies, and looking to do it very, very soon.&quot;              &quot;Given our visibility we know they&apos;re serious people, bent on destruction,&quot; he said. The small group of al-Qaida veterans from Afghanistan and Pakistan was targeted in strikes near Aleppo, Syria, last month. Senior U.S. officials have not said whether the group&apos;s plots have been disrupted.              Comey said the U.S. believes there are about a dozen Americans fighting alongside extremist groups in Syria. He said if someone has fought alongside the Islamic State militant group and tries to come back to the U.S., &quot;we will track them very carefully.&quot;              He said Americans should have confidence in changes made since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, pointing to a government &quot;better organized, better systems, better equipment, smarter deployment.

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla) (The Associated Press)PreviousNextBEIRUT –  In his high-rise office in Beirut, Sandro Saade carefully chews a merlot grape from a vineyard hundreds of miles away in war-ravaged Syria, trying to determine if it is ripe enough to order the start of the harvest.              It&apos;s too dangerous for him to travel to the vineyards of Domaine de Bargylus, which is nestled in verdant hills where wine has been produced since ancient times. But despite the bloody conflict and the threat of Islamic extremists, he is determined to produce world-class wines, and to help preserve a Levantine cosmopolitanism imperiled by decades of war.              In Syria and Lebanon, boutique wineries mainly run by Christians have endured despite decades of unrest and the fact that Islam —  the majority faith in the region  —  forbids both the production and consumption of alcohol. The challenges have mounted since the eruption of Syria&apos;s conflict in 2011 and the rise of the Islamic State extremist group and other jihadist organizations.              For families like the Saades, the production of wine is not only a business but an affirmation of their roots in a region increasingly hostile to Christians and other minorities. Their winery&apos;s name derives from the classical Greek for the Syrian mountains overlooking the Mediterranean, and the tradition of wine-making stretches back to ancient times, when it flowed at bacchanalian festivals that would horrify today&apos;s dour jihadists.              &quot;We are passionate about this, and we aren&apos;t stopping. We will continue as much as we can,&quot; Saade said. &quot;The challenge is not just to make wine, but to maintain a high quality wine.&quot;              The winery is in a relatively secure part of Syria still controlled by the President Bashar Assad&apos;s secular government, which tolerates alcohol. But stray mortars occasionally crash into the vineyards, including one that destroyed 15 chardonnay vines in June.              Transportation presents other obstacles. As well-off businessmen, the Saades are at risk of being kidnapped by militants or brigands on the increasingly perilous roads crossing the Syrian-Lebanese border. The grapes are shuttled back and forth by taxi drivers, who are occasionally forced to turn back when security forces close the crossings.              The Islamic State extremist group is far from the wineries, but it has captured a third of Syria and Iraq, including in lightning advances that took much of the region by surprise. Other powerful Islamic militant groups, including a local al-Qaida affiliate, are much closer. As a security precaution, the winery keeps most of its finished product in a Belgian warehouse.              The enterprise is tiny, with Bargylus producing just 45,000 bottles a year. Like its Lebanese competitors, it tries to market premier boutique wines for around $35 a bottle.              In a 2012 article discussing Bargylus wines, international expert Jancis Robinson was &quot;particularly impressed by the 2007 Bargylus red, a well-judged blend of syrah with cabernet sauvignon and merlot with real savour and depth of flavor.&quot;              Saade said surprising Europeans with the provenance of his wine was part of his marketing strategy: &quot;They are smiling when they discover that. It&apos;s definitely a good surprise.&quot;              Saade said in an interview last month that this season&apos;s grapes were &quot;nearly ready.&quot; Another taxi would fetch more grapes in three days&apos; time  —  if the border was open.              Lebanon&apos;s own wineries have thus far been spared from the conflict in neighboring Syria, but the war is never far off. In August, it spilled across the border when militants from Syria briefly overran the border town of Arsal, killing and abducting several police and soldiers. Two were later beheaded by the Islamic State group.              The Lebanese wine industry is concentrated in the eastern Bekaa region, a sweeping plain framed by Syria&apos;s mountains that has long been a stronghold of the militant Shiite Hezbollah movement. More recently, the religiously mixed region has come to host hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, fueling tensions.              Lebanon is fiercely divided over the war in Syria, and outbreaks of violence have seen Sunni and Shiite villagers in the Bekaa block roads and engage in tit-for-tat kidnappings.              &quot;The situation is abnormal,&quot; said Zafer Chaoui, head of Lebanon&apos;s official association of wine producers, and the director of Chateau Ksara, the country&apos;s largest winery, one of 47 that produced some 8 million bottles last year.              Most wineries emerged after Lebanon&apos;s civil war ended in 1990, but here too wine-making is an ancient tradition. The nearby Roman complex at Baalbek features a temple to Bacchus, the god of wine and mirth.              Lebanon&apos;s sizable Christian community drinks, as do many liberal Muslims, but local sales have declined 10 t0 20 percent this year as part of a larger economic downturn.              In the vineyards of Chateau Kefraya, just a few miles from the Syrian border, women with scarves across their faces  —  protection against flies  —  snip dark bunches of syrah grapes.              Most of the women are Syrian refugees who fled from the eastern city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State group&apos;s self-styled caliphate. There the punishment for drinking is 100 lashes.              &quot;This keeps my children alive,&quot; said 21-year-old Hiam, a mother of two, speaking of her $4 daily wage to pick 16 boxes of grapes.              The war is never far behind. Sometimes explosions from across the border echo like approaching thunder, and armed men conduct nightly patrols of the nearby village, fearing Islamic State militants might cross the border.              The supervisor at Chateau Kefraya, 53-year-old Nabhan Nabhan, takes it all in stride. &quot;From the time I was born, it&apos;s been like this,&quot; he said, ticking off the long list of conflicts that have darkened this bucolic region during his lifetime.              Others are more fearful. &quot;Who can say we will not be next?&quot; asks Fabrice Guiberteau, the French technical director and a long-time resident of Lebanon. &quot;The situation is dramatic.&quot;              At the nearby Chateau Ksara, employee Rania Chammas mapped out a longer, alternative route back to Beirut for visiting reporters. Armed Shiite demonstrators had blocked the main road with burning tires to protest against the government&apos;s failure to recover the abducted soldiers.              &quot;You had better leave,&quot; she sighed."

Local health officials have been overwhelmed by the spread of the virus, and some say the case of the delayed container is a vivid illustration of how government corruption has undercut efforts to fight Ebola as well. The Times reports that the shipment was organized by Chernoh Alpha Bah, an opposition politician in Sierra Leone. A government official told the paper that approval of the shipment may have been delayed to prevent the opposition from scoring political points about their response to the outbreak. The paper also reported that the $6,500 shipping fee for the container had not been paid by the Sierra Leone government, resulting in three other other containers of supplies being kept at the docks by the shipping company. According to The Times, government officials disputed the fee before arguing that proper shipping protocols had not been followed. An official at the country&apos;s health ministry said the shipment should have been cleared with them first, before adding that the supplies would be cleared &quot;very soon.&quot;Meanwhile, another would-be donor, an expatriate Sierra Leonean living in Canada, tells the paper his shipment has been delayed for over a month because of the government&apos;s unwillingness to pay a $5,000 shipping fee. In context, the government official told The Times that the country has received over $40 million in cash donations to help fight Ebola. Sierra Leone is still recovering from an 11-year-long civil war, and the country&apos;s health ministry was beset by corruption charges levied at dozens of health officials over misappropriation of vaccination funds. Click for more from The New York Times."

The main topic was the performance of both Koreas at the Asian Games, which ended Saturday with a closing ceremony attended by the North Korean group.The two sides also agreed to hold further talks about cross-border issues in coming weeks, ending a diplomatic standoff since early this year and raising expectations about rapprochement. Those hopes were reinforced by television coverage showing the two sides laughing and joking with each other.The weekend meeting was a “small but meaningful step” for inter-Korean relations, a senior official from the South’s Unification Ministry said on Monday.“It’s significant that South and North Korean officials had an opportunity to open dialogue,” the official said.Preparations are under way for renewed talks on issues such as reunions of families separated by the Korean War, the official said.

Elsewhere in the Pacific, a separate typhoon whipped the Mariana Islands, including Guam, with high winds and heavy rain.              In Japan, bullet train service was suspended between Tokyo and Osaka because of the heavy rainfall, and more than 600 flights were canceled at Tokyo&apos;s Haneda Airport. The trains resumed service later in the day, although with delays.              Typhoon Phanfone came ashore near the city of Hamamatsu shortly after 8 a.m., and traveled northward before turning eastward into the Pacific north of Tokyo.              Authorities advised more than 2 million people to evacuate, according to Kyodo News service.              One of the three U.S. airmen who went missing on Okinawa&apos;s northern coast was found dead. The other two were missing, according to the Air Force and the Japanese coast guard.              The Air Force said the search for the missing airmen had been interrupted by rough seas. Their names were being withheld pending notification of relatives. Okinawa is home to about half of the roughly 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.              Japanese broadcaster NHK reported one death, with five people missing. NHK footage showed flooded areas of Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, where people were wading in knee-high muddy water, and buildings and parked cars were sitting in big pools of water.              The search for a dozen people still missing after a volcanic eruption in central Japan was suspended Sunday, and did not resume Monday, because of worries about possible landsides. The Sept. 27 eruption killed at least 51 hikers.              In the Marianas, the eye of Typhoon Vongfong skirted Rota, a small island with about 2,500 residents where many buildings are made of concrete.              Power outages and minor flooding were reported Monday morning. But by early afternoon, there were no reports of injuries or major damage anywhere on the islands as the storm moved away from the region. The weather service canceled a flash-flood watch for the islands.              Tanya King, who was in Sinapolo, one of the population centers on Rota, said via Facebook messenger that she was without electricity and it was still very windy hours after the eye passed. She said a friend living near the ocean had broken windows, &quot;but all is well.&quot;              The brunt of the storm bypassed Guam, where many residents heeded warnings about high winds and flooding by taking refuge in designated shelters.              As conditions improved, Guam officials shut down the island&apos;s storm center, the airport resumed full operations, and government agencies and many businesses began reopening. There was some flooding in low-lying areas, but roads were passable.              Typhoon Vongfong had maximum sustained winds of about 195 kilometers (105 miles) per hour, said Roger Edson of the National Weather Service in Guam.

But he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the person&apos;s story.&quot;As long as the identity of the cadavers has not been resolved we will continue the search&quot; for the missing students, he said Sunday.State police and prosecutors have been investigating the Iguala city police for misconduct during a series of violent incidents last weekend that resulted in six shooting deaths and more than two dozen people injured. Investigators said video showed police taking away an undetermined number of student protesters.Authorities have presented charges against 29 people in the case, including 22 police officers detained soon after the violence. Three of the suspects are fugitives, including Iguala&apos;s police chief.Blanco said they are still investigating the motive for the crime, adding that some of the police have connections to a local drug cartel.Blanco said Saturday that some of those arrested provided key clues that led investigators to the six unmarked burial pits on an isolated hillside about a mile from the nearest road. The bodies had been put in the pits on top of branches and tree trunks, which were doused with a flammable substance such as gasoline and set on fire.Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer helping families of the missing students, said relatives of 37 of the young people already had provided DNA samples that will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students.As investigators worked at the grave site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice. &quot;You took them alive, we want them returned alive,&quot; read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.The mother of one of the missing youths said her son, 17-year-old Luis Angel Abarca Carrillo, had enrolled in the Aytozinapa teachers college attended by the missing students in order to get ahead in life and not be a poor farmer like his brothers.&quot;But now look what they did to him, he hasn&apos;t reappeared,&quot; said 60-year-old Margarita Carrillo.Mexico&apos;s National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible &quot;serious human rights abuses,&quot; such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.The commission said in a statement Sunday that it had warned about the &quot;delicate&quot; situation in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the Aytozinapa teachers college protested outside the governor&apos;s residence in Chilpancingo.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)HONG KONG –  Hong Kong&apos;s civil servants returned to work and schools were reopening Monday as a massive pro-democracy protest that has occupied much of the city center for the week dwindled.Student demonstrators say they have taken early steps to begin talks with the government on their demands for wider political reforms, but actual negotiations have not started and many disagreements remain.At the government headquarters, where some protesters agreed to remove barriers blocking roads Sunday ahead of the government&apos;s deadline to scale back their protests, the scene was orderly as government officials arrived for work as a few dozen remaining protesters looked on.The crowds had thinned markedly after a week that saw tens of thousands of people fill the streets in peaceful protest. In Mong Kok, another protest site across the harbor where protesters had clashed violently with their opponents, a few hundred activists were staying put at the sit-in site.Some activists disagree with the partial withdrawal at government headquarters, and an alliance of students say they will keep up their protests until details of the talks are worked out.&quot;If the government uses force to clear away protesters, there will be no room for dialogue,&quot; Lester Shum, one of the group&apos;s leaders, told reporters.Alex Chow, another student leader, said he was not worried about the crowd dwindling.&quot;Because people need rest, but they will come out again. It doesn&apos;t mean the movement is diminishing. Many people still support it,&quot; Chow said.Students occupying an area just outside city government headquarters agreed to remove some barricades that were blocking the building&apos;s entrance, after the government said it would do whatever was necessary to ensure 3,000 civil servants would have full access to their offices on Monday.The partial withdrawal appeared to be part of a strategy to regroup in another part of town, as protesters were urged to shift from other areas to Hong Kong&apos;s Admiralty shopping and business district, a central location near the government&apos;s main offices that has served as an informal headquarters for the protests.Protesters had feared that officials may clear the streets by force, but by Monday it&apos;s clear the government was settling for a partial victory in clearing some roads. The government indicated some disruptions were likely to continue.&quot;To restore order, we are determined, and we are confident we have the capability to take any necessary action,&quot; police spokesman Steve Hui said. &quot;There should not be any unreasonable, unnecessary obstruction by any members of the public.&quot;Television footage showed a man shaking hands with a police officer outside government headquarters and the two sides removing some barricades together. About 300 demonstrators stood by outside the government building&apos;s main entrance, but then many sat back down and refused to leave.&quot;I&apos;m against any kind of withdrawal or tendency to surrender,&quot; said Do Chan, a protester in his 30s. &quot;I think withdrawing, I mean shaking hands with the police, is a very ugly gesture of surrender.&quot;The situation remained volatile across the harbor in Hong Kong&apos;s Mong Kok district, a shopping area where ugly confrontations broke out Friday and Saturday after opponents of the protesters tried to force them out. Many demonstrators heeded calls to head home or shift to the Admiralty area. A few hundred, however, remained.&quot;I don&apos;t know what the next step is, but I will not retreat. The people you see here will not retreat,&quot; said Burnett Tung, an 18-year-old student who has served as a volunteer at a food-supply station outside government headquarters all week.Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets of the semi-autonomous city since Sept. 28 to peacefully protest China&apos;s restrictions on the first-ever direct election for Hong Kong&apos;s leader, promised by Beijing for 2017. The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Hong Kong -- and in Beijing -- since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.China has promised that Hong Kong can have universal suffrage by 2017, but it says a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures must screen candidates for the top job. The protesters also are demanding the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city&apos;s current leader. He has refused to step down.With the standoff stretching into a second week, tempers have flared and patience was waning among residents who oppose the occupation of the streets and the disruption it has brought.Police said they had arrested 30 people since the start of the protests. Protesters, meanwhile, complained the police were failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away."

(AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) (The Associated Press)PreviousNextRIO DE JANEIRO –  It&apos;s the presidential election that just keeps surprising.              A year after a spasm of huge anti-government protests across Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff piled up more votes in Sunday&apos;s election than any challenger, but it wasn&apos;t enough to avoid a runoff in three weeks.              The race kept up its unpredictable nature as Aecio Neves, a center-right former governor and senator with deep political lineage, came in second. He had languished in the polls during the campaign but surged in the past week to overtake former environment minister Marina Silva, who at one time was the front-runner.              In late August, Silva held a double-digit lead over the field after only entering the race following the death of her Socialist Party&apos;s initial candidate in a plane crash. But then her reputation and credentials were picked apart by aggressive campaigning from Rousseff&apos;s long-governing Workers&apos; Party.              With nearly all the votes counted, the president had 41.5 percent to Neves&apos; 33.6 percent. Silva got 21 percent.              The Oct. 26 runoff will now pit the candidates of Brazil&apos;s two most powerful parties, which together have produced all of Brazil&apos;s presidents the past 20 years and are well known to Brazilians.              Neves is backed by the well-organized Social Democracy Party, which held the presidency from 1994 until 2002, a period when Brazil tamed hyperinflation and turned the economy around.              &quot;Aecio&apos;s performance has been extraordinary, and one of the reasons for this is the very strong party structure behind him —  a party with a strong nationwide presence and which has been in the presidency,&quot; said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil&apos;s leading think tank. &quot;It is now a new election where everything is wide open. Aecio, who until recently no one believed had a chance, has emerged as a very strong candidate.&quot;              Neves is an economist and former two-term governor of Minas Gerais, Brazil&apos;s second-most populous state, where he left office in 2010 with an approval rating above 90 percent.              He has strong name recognition in Brazil as the grandson of Tancredo Neves, a widely beloved figure who was chosen to become Brazil&apos;s first post-dictatorship president but fell ill and died before taking office.              Neves emphasized those roots in a statement Sunday night.              &quot;What I can say, what comes to mind, is what my grandfather Tancredo said 30 years ago when he won the elections for president of the republic: &apos;We must not get dispersed. We are just in the middle of our path.&apos; And I hope to be able to walk alongside every Brazilian who wants a dignified and efficient government to the end,&quot; said the 54-year-old politician, who also has served four terms as a congressman and one as a senator.              Rousseff&apos;s aggressive campaigning proved the downfall for Silva, who had been thought poised to tap into the widespread disdain Brazilians hold for the political class  —  anger that boiled over into last year&apos;s roiling protests. But Silva couldn&apos;t withstand the president&apos;s barrage of attacks labeling her as indecisive and without the mettle needed to lead the globe&apos;s fifth-largest nation.              &quot;Marina Silva tried but was not able to convey her message of change. She&apos;s only responding to attacks,&quot; said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. &quot;We&apos;ve seen negative campaigning before, but never at this level of ferocity.&quot;              During nearly 12 years in power, the Workers&apos; Party has ushered in strong social programs that have helped lift millions out of poverty and into the middle class. Rousseff&apos;s strongest support comes from the poorest, those who are precariously hanging onto gains amid an economy that has sputtered the past four years.              In contrast to Neves&apos; call for more centrist economic approaches, Rousseff promised in her campaign to expand social programs and continue strong state involvement in the economy, a stand that has drawn criticism from the business sector.              &quot;I feel strongly I received a message, a simple message saying I must continue moving forward ... to change Brazil,&quot; Rousseff told a crowd of supporters late Sunday.              ___              Associated Press writers Brad Brooks and Jenny Barchfield reported this story in Rio de Janeiro and AP writer Stan Lehman reported from Sao Paulo.              ___              Brad Brooks on Twitter: www.twitter.com/bradleybrooks"

Official results showed Sunday that President Dilma Rousseff will face challenger Aecio Neves in a second-round vote in Brazil&apos;s most unpredictable presidential election since the nation&apos;s return to democracy nearly three decades ago. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)RIO DE JANEIRO –  Brazil&apos;s unpredictable election took another twist Sunday, with left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff being forced into a runoff race as expected, but against a center-right challenger who only surged in the final week of the campaign.Rousseff will face Aecio Neves in the Oct. 26 runoff vote, required as no single candidate won an outright majority. With over 99 percent of the vote counted, the president had won 41.5 percent against Neves&apos; 33.6 percent.As surprising as Neves&apos; rise was the fall from grace of another candidate, former environment minister Marina Silva, who took just 21 percent of the vote. In late August, she held a double-digit lead over Rousseff in polls after being thrust into the race when her Socialist Party&apos;s first candidate died in a plane crash.But over the past three weeks, the powerful political machine of Rousseff&apos;s Workers&apos; Party eviscerated Silva with what some analysts called the most negative and aggressive campaigning Brazil has seen since returning to democracy nearly 30 years ago. Silva fell hard in polls and could never regain her footing or get her message out.Neves, however, had the backing of the well-organized Social Democracy Party, which held the presidency from 1994 until 2002, a period when Brazil tamed its hyperinflation and turned its economy around.&quot;Aecio&apos;s performance has been extraordinary and one of the reasons for this is the very strong party structure behind him -- a party with a strong nationwide presence and which has been in the presidency,&quot; said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst with the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil&apos;s leading think tank. &quot;It is now a new election where everything is wide open.

Neves began his political career at age 23 as the personal secretary to his grandfather, Tancredo Neves, a widely beloved figure who was chosen to become Brazil&apos;s first post-dictatorship president but fell ill and died before taking office.Neves emphasized those family roots in a statement late Sunday.&quot;What I can say, what comes to mind, is what my grandfather Tancredo said 30 years ago when he won the elections for president of the republic: `We must not get dispersed. We are just in the middle of our path.&apos; And I hope to be able to walk alongside every Brazilian who wants a dignified and efficient government to the end. I am going to fight for that,&quot; he said.One year after his grandfather&apos;s death, Neves was elected to the first of four terms as congressman. The 54-year-old father of three also served one term as senator.Neves&apos; reputation took a hit in July, Brazil&apos;s biggest newspaper Folha de S.Paulo alleged Neves&apos; government spent around $5.5 million to build an airport on land belonging to an uncle of the then-governor. Neves later contested the accusations in an editorial in the same newspaper.Carlos Ernanny, a retired 68-year-old in Rio de Janeiro, said he voted for Neves out of &quot;hope for our Brazil.&quot;&quot;His good sense, his moral compass gives me hope for economic growth and development,&quot; he said, a common refrain among Neves supporters because of his business-friendly, centrist stance.As for the fall of Silva, it was Rousseff&apos;s aggressive campaigning that cut her support.It was thought Silva could tap into the widespread disdain Brazilians hold for the political class -- anger that boiled over into roiling, nationwide anti-government protests last year.But she couldn&apos;t withstand a barrage of attacks labeling her as indecisive and without the mettle needed to lead the globe&apos;s fifth-largest nation -- the message pounded on by Rousseff.&quot;Marina Silva tried but was not able to convey her message of change. She&apos;s only responding to attacks,&quot; said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. &quot;We&apos;ve seen negative campaigning before, but never at this level of ferocity.&quot;During nearly 12 years in power, the Workers&apos; Party has ushered in strong social programs that have helped lift millions out of poverty and into the middle class. Rousseff&apos;s strongest support comes from the poorest, those who are precariously hanging onto gains amid an economy that has sputtered the past four years.&quot;I don&apos;t think a sudden change would be good for the country. That could be dangerous,&quot; said Diego Almeida, a 26-year-old university student and resident of Rio&apos;s biggest slum who said he voted for Rousseff.Still, he expressed the frustration millions of Brazilians have with their leaders: &quot;They&apos;ve had 500 years to fix this country and for 500 years they&apos;ve failed. I just hope that something happens in the next 500 years.&quot;Rousseff promises to expand social programs and continue strong state involvement in the economy, even though critics complain it creates a poor business environment and the main stock market tumbled every time a new poll showed her on the rise.Neves offers more centrist economic approaches, such as central bank independence, more privatizations and the pursuit of trade deals with Europe and the United States."

What is this &quot;anti-Facebook&quot; I&apos;m hearing about?A. The latest site to challenge Facebook on the social network scene is called Ello. It has a very clean – almost sparse – look, it doesn&apos;t show you ads and it claims to keep your information private. That&apos;s about as opposite of Facebook as you can get. Of course, it has a number of challenges to overcome. Click here to learn more about Ello and find out if it has a shot at dethroning Facebook.Stay safe on public Wi-FiQ. Is it true that hackers can see what I&apos;m doing online if we&apos;re on the same Wi-Fi network?A. Yes, it&apos;s called &quot;packet sniffing&quot; and it lets hackers see usernames, passwords, site addresses, text messages, email and plenty of other things you do. The good news is that it&apos;s easy to protect yourself with encryption. A VPN app like HotSpot Shield VPN will do the trick. You can also use the browser plug-in HTTPS Everywhere to force sites with encryption to use it all the time.

Maybe I just wasn&apos;t paying attention, but what happened to Windows 9?A. No, your attention is just fine. Microsoft decided to skip 9 and jump straight to 10, because the next Windows is such a large step in features it deserves a milestone number. Most of what Microsoft is excited about is back-end stuff. What most consumers will care about is that Windows 10 will work just like Windows 7 on laptops and desktops, with a few improvements.

Given how many viruses there are out there and the wide range of ways they work, detecting a virus isn&apos;t as easy as it used to be. Here are five signs that can tip you off. Naturally, you&apos;ll want to start with your security software – you do have some installed, right? – and then follow up with a second opinion from a scanner like Malwarebytes. If those don&apos;t find anything, then you probably don’t have a virus. But to be totally sure, you can fire up AVG Rescue CD. This runs a scan before any virus has a chance to start, so it catches viruses that are really well hidden. Of course, finding the virus is just the first step.

No, not your firstborn child (although some people in London agreed to do just that). I&apos;m talking about security.You can find free Wi-Fi hotspots everywhere, and you can even scout them out before you travel using an app like Free Wi-Fi Finder. Just keep in mind that crooks have several ways to snag your information when you’re using a Wi-Fi hotspot. I&apos;m going to tell you three of the most popular methods, and how to protect yourself.1. Honeypot Wi-Fi networksMost free Wi-Fi comes courtesy of a coffee shop or hotel. (See if your prospective hotel has fast Wi-Fi.) But that free network might actually be a hacker-run router.Hackers have no problem setting up a router in a public area and naming it something like &quot;coffee shop Wi-Fi&quot; or &quot;free hotel Wi-Fi.&quot; It might even use the name of a business in the area. Plenty of people will connect without thinking.Even worse, a hacker might set up next to a legitimate Wi-Fi network and give his network the same name. Even if you spot the duplication in the network list, you won&apos;t know which one is safe.Once you connect to the hacker&apos;s network, he can start probing your gadget for weaknesses and slip in viruses or spy on your browsing. He can also redirect your browsing so you end up on malicious websites.How do you stay safe? Well, staying off public Wi-Fi is the safest option, but that kind of misses the point. Instead, make sure you check with the business you&apos;re visiting to verify the name of the Wi-Fi network – many places will require you to get a password anyway.Then, make sure you scroll through the list of networks in the area. If you spot more than one with the same name, let the business know. In most cases, it will be because the business has a dual-band Wi-Fi router that creates two networks – one at 2.4Ghz and one at 5Ghz. You can&apos;t be too careful, though.Make sure your gadget&apos;s operating system is up to date, along with the browser (see if your browser needs updating) and security software. That way, there won&apos;t be holes for hackers to exploit.You can also grab a VPN app to encrypt your Internet connection. That way, hackers won&apos;t be able to snoop on what you&apos;re sending and receiving. Click here for a popular VPN and other ways to keep info thieves off your gadget.2. Packet sniffingOf course, you don&apos;t have to connect to hackers&apos; routers for them to snoop. Being on the same legitimate network is enough to cause trouble, thanks to packet sniffing.When you send and receive data over the Internet, the information is sent in millions of tiny packets. Hackers use packet sniffers to intercept these packets and read them to see what you&apos;re doing.That includes snagging usernames and passwords, reading your email, texts or social media posts and seeing what sites you&apos;re visiting. This takes some tweaked hardware and special software, but it isn&apos;t anything a halfway competent hacker can&apos;t put together.To protect yourself, you can use a VPN app or site to create an encrypted connection, as I mentioned above. You&apos;ll also want to avoid visiting important sites, such as banking sites, on public Wi-Fi.If you must bank on the go, use the bank&apos;s app on your smartphone or tablet over a cellular connection. Click here for the most critical steps you need to take for secure online banking.3. Shared foldersMost people use Wi-Fi networks to access the Internet, and it&apos;s easy to forget that the whole point of networking is to share information among computers or gadgets on the same network.If your gadget is set to share folders automatically, then anyone – not just a hacker – can see what you&apos;re sharing.Fortunately, Windows Vista, 7 and 8 make it simple to automate your sharing settings. When connecting to a public hotspot for the first time, Windows asks for a location type. Make sure you set it to &quot;public.&quot; This will automatically modify sharing settings for maximum safety.Click here for a program that can tell you more about your sharing and other potentially vulnerable Windows settings.On a Mac, go to System Preferences&gt;&gt;Sharing and make sure all the sharing boxes are unchecked. You&apos;ll have to turn on the controls again when you want to share files on your home or work network.For now, you don&apos;t really need to worry about this on a smartphone or tablet.Of course, it works the other way. An enterprising hacker or prankster might share a &quot;honeypot&quot; folder on a public network. If your computer is connected, you might see it under your &quot;shared&quot; folders and be fooled into opening it.Let&apos;s say a hacker names a file &quot;sexyphoto.jpg&quot; or &quot;diary.txt&quot; – you know some people are going to open them. But they could actually be viruses in disguise that infect your computer. When it comes to file sharing on public Wi-Fi, the rule is: Share nothing and don&apos;t be nosy.I said in the beginning that these were the three most popular ways hackers attack. Click here to learn even more ways to stay safe when using public Wi-Fi.On the Kim Komando Show, the nation&apos;s largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today&apos;s digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

We were delighted to use the phone number Consumer Reports published to eliminate robocalls; we’re pretty sure it worked, too. But how do I get real people to stop calling at dinnertime? Could it be that putting your name on a do-not-call list indicates that there’s a live person at the end of the number?—Brent Harward, Austin, TX  A. Signing up for the Do Not Call registry should protect you from unwanted telemarketing calls: That includes live calls from real people and “robocalls,” which use recorded messages or automatic dialers for live people to reach you. Companies are required to check the National Do Not Call registry; if your name is listed, they’re prohibited from contacting you.  But certain companies and scammers ignore the list, and technological changes are making it easier for callers to harass you and to cover their tracks with phony caller IDs. Consumer Reports is pushing federal regulators to step up efforts to enforce the rules and to punish callers who disregard them. In the meantime, the best way to help reduce those intrusions is still to add your information to the National Do Not Call list at donotcall.gov or 888-382-1222. The free service works for residential and wireless numbers; once you sign up, your number remains on the list as long as your phone is in use—unless you decide to opt out.

Although a more traditional sports property, digital media company The Bleacher Report was reportedly acquired for around $200 million by Turner Broadcasting System in 2012.Could The Players’ Tribune eventually reach a valuation in the hundreds of millions of dollars? Quite possibly, according to MediaMoxie’s Horan.“The sky’s the limit, it’s the American Dream,” she told FoxNews.com.Courtney Brunious, associate director of the University of Southern California’s Sports Business Institute, believes that the website could be a social media home run for Jeter. Athletes, he told FoxNews.com, can give a fresh perspective by speaking directly to fans, a message which will be amplified by Jeter’s star power.“Jeter has built a fan base that’s interested in anything that he does – he can also bring people in through the strength of his brand,” Brunious said.The 40 year-old future Hall of Famer has been a brand magnet through the course of his career, clinching deals with Nike, Gatorade, Steiner Sports, Rawlings, Movado, 24-Hour Fitness, Avon and health food company Luvo. Thanks partly to these endorsements, Jeter has a net worth of $185 million, according to TheRichest.com.Vicki Michaelis, professor of sports media at the University of Georgia’s Grady College, agrees that The Players’ Tribune could have a big impact.“I think it’s very powerful,” she told FoxNews.com. “This is definitely another step in the evolution of social media – the middle man, the media is being removed from the relationship with the fans.”Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, listed as senior editor, is the site’s first contributor, and has penned a column on domestic violence.At this stage, however, specific details of The Players’ Tribune, such as future contributors, the scale of Jeter’s investment, and even its business model, have not been revealed.Forbes reports that Jeter is the main investor for the website and will maintain a hands-on role. Legendary Entertainment, the movie and TV production giant behind blockbusters such as “The Dark Knight” and the “Hangover” series, is also involved. In a statement released on Wednesday, the film company said that it will be providing “creative support as well as capital” to The Players’ Tribune. Legendary Entertainment declined to provide additional details about its investment when contacted by FoxNews.com.Jeter has already brought in some big hitters to work on The Players’ Tribune. Gary Hoenig, former editorial director of ESPN Publishing, is the new website’s editorial director. Maureen Cavanagh, former photography director for Sports Illustrated, is The Players’ Tribune creative director. Other hires include Sarah Turcotte, former general editor at ESPN The Magazine, who serves as the site’s executive editor.However, despite all the buzz around Jeter’s latest venture, there are plenty of hurdles in its path, according to Horan.“There could be rights issues,” she told FoxNews.com. “That’s one of the gory details that has to be worked out.”An Adidas-sponsored contributor to the site, for example, could pose a branding problem, given Jeter’s close relationship with Nike, according to experts.Jeter’s promise of “unfiltered voices” will also be closely scrutinized. “We will see how unfiltered these comments really are, because a lot of these athletes have publicists who ensure that they stay on message,” said USC’s Brunious.Then, of course, there’s the challenge of keeping readers engaged. “It’s going to depend on the day-to-day content flow and how interesting it is,” said Brunious. “Readers are going to want something that’s more interesting than your typical ‘player speak’.”&quot;I think that what he&apos;s doing is good, but if they are going to sell advertising off this site, they are going to have to get a lot of eyeballs,&quot; added Rick Burton, Falk Professor of Sport Management at Syracuse University. &quot;You would need a lot of content.&quot;Alvin Lieberman, a marketing professor at NYU and director of the school’s entertainment, media, and technology program, sees fierce competition for The Players’ Tribune. “Jeter has to fight among the 200-plus cable channels and the many thousands of social networks,” he told FoxNews.com. “Will he make an impression? Yes. The question is, how long will it last?’’Sports and entertainment consultant and Columbia University Professor Joe Favorito told FoxNews.com that, at this stage, it’s impossible to make any long-term predictions about Jeter’s website. “Whether it’s a viable business, no one can say, because no one really knows what it is yet,” he said.The Players’ Tribune has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers"

Percenti was arrested last week for allegedly firing a shotgun at an aerial remote control “helicopter” drone flying in the vicinity of his home. According to the owner of the helicopter drone, it was being used to capture photographs of a nearby home that was currently under construction. While he was flying the drone over the unfinished home to take the photos, he heard several gunshots in the vicinity and immediately lost control of the drone.When the owner recovered the broken drone, he discovered multiple holes that were likely the result of at least one shotgun blast. After calling the Lower Township Police Department, the drone owner directed patrolman Michael Nuscis toward the origin of the shots. Police officers went to the home of Percenti, questioned him about the shooting and discovered the shotgun that was used in the drone attack. Upon discovery of the shotgun, Percenti was placed under arrest and charged with possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and criminal mischief. In addition, the shotgun was seized as evidence related to the crime.Bail was set in the amount of $2,500 by a local judge and Percenti quickly posted the 10 percent required minimum to be released from jail. In addition the criminal charges, the owner may choose to pursue financial compensation for the destroyed drone.Depending on the type of drone as well as the quality of the digital camera mounted to the drone, Percenti could be responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in damages.Regarding the law, the FAA has set guidelines that require drone fliers to stay below 400 feet when operating a remote control drone as well as keeping clear of nearby airports. New Jersey legislators attempted to pass specific drone legislation earlier this year related to operation of the devices, but it was vetoed by Governor Chris Christie during January 2014."

He&apos;s apologized for his behavior, but the goal is to prevent folks who are over the limit from getting behind the wheel in the first place. Not surprisingly, there are gadgets – and apps – to help stop them.You may have faced a situation in which you were trying to convince a friend not to drive, or you may have wondered if that last glass of wine was enough to impair your own judgment. A personal breathalyzer, which cost from $30 to $120, can do the trick by demonstrating objectively that you or a companion has had one – or more – too many.Matchbox-sized personal breathalyzers measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) based on the level of alcohol in your breath (about 10 percent of the alcohol you drink is released into your breath). From that reading, they estimate the percentage of alcohol in your blood. Generally, these devices use either a semiconductor sensor, which is small and inexpensive, or a fuel cell sensor, which can be more accurate and is used by law enforcement in portable devices. I tested two models that work with smartphones.The Breathometer costs $50 and plugs into the headphone jack of an iPhone or Android smartphone. It uses a semiconductor sensor and an AAA battery that should last for up to 75 tests. The company recommends waiting until 20 minutes after your last drink for a more accurate test, as it will avoid higher results from the alcohol residue in your mouth. It takes about a minute to warm up the device, and then you’re prompted to blow for four to five seconds through a hole from about two inches away.I had to retest for accuracy several times. And in one case, after I toted it around in my briefcase, the sensor collected too much lint to be effective. (It was easily blown clear, however.)But the Breathometer was reasonably accurate. If anything, it tended to err on the side of caution by yielding slightly higher results. One evening, after a glass of wine, I blew a 0.03, eliciting a yellow warning and a note: &quot;You should be sober at 12:17 AM&quot; – roughly 2 hours away. A retest brought the number down. And here’s a bonus feature: The app provides a list of local cab companies.Breathalyzers need to be calibrated regularly, and the Breathometer is no exception. The company says it should be recalibrated every 250 tests, or after nine months. The mail-in service costs $20Alcohoot, another smartphone accessory, is a competitor. It costs $100, but it uses a fuel cell sensor, the same technology police officers use, and it has a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that will last for up to 500 tests. It&apos;s slightly larger than the Breathometer, and it works almost identically. You blow through a hole where the sensor is. The company recommends using one of the eight washable and reusable plastic mouthpieces that come with the device.The Alcohoot started up more quickly and delivered consistent results, probably because I used the nozzle. I blew a typical 0.017 after a large glass of wine. The program reminded me that the legal limit is 0.08 BAC. The app charted my reading and the time of day, and it recorded that I was below the red line that denotes the legal limit. It also warned me, &quot;You may begin to feel moderate effects.&quot; I noted that I could call an Uber, Lyft or Hailo car service from the app.In addition to being more accurate, the higher-priced Alcohoot doesn&apos;t need to be recalibrated as often as the Breathometer. The company says it lasts for up to 1,000 tests or one year. Its recalibration service costs $30.I trusted the Alcohoot more than the Breathometer, mainly because of its ergonomics, but keep in mind that while these are FDA registered devices, they are not a license to drink and drive. Both companies repeatedly note that you should not do so.Furthermore, breathalyzers can be imprecise. Using a mouthwash or breath spray can affect the accuracy of the measurement, and alcohol affects everyone differently. On the other hand, having one of these devices at the ready to convince a friend that he should take a cab or sleep on the couch could end up saving a life. John R.

The news comes from India’s Economic Times, and the article states the search company will test the app in the country next year. If you’re wondering what’s wrong with Hangouts, then there is a key difference between the two – Google’s new messenger app won’t require a Google login.Most popular Google apps, such as Google+, Gmail, and the Google Play Store, need the user to have a Google account. While hardly restrictive, it can be an issue if Google doesn’t have a large presence in the respective market. There’s also the case some people may not want to sign up with Google at all.Google’s possible decision to put some effort into a cross-platform, Google-free messaging app may have been influenced by Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, and a desire to not lose ground in emerging markets. WhatsApp, for example, has 65 million users in India alone, and Viber’s new owner has major international expansion plans too. We’ve seen this strategy before recently, after BlackBerry let its BBM app out into the world, aiming it primarily at countries such as Africa. Google’s app may be localized to include multi-language support, giving it stronger appeal.There’s no official confirmation from Google, but an anonymous source informed the Economic Times the new app would launch in 2015, and would be free to use. This sets it apart from WhatsApp, which charges a modest annual fee, and puts it in competition with the free – and feature-packed – Line app."

Vazquez II, U.S. Navy)The Navy and Raytheon recently flight tested software upgrades to the Tomahawk missile with two sea-launched test-firings near China Lake, Calif., designed to shoot the weapon up to high altitudes and assess the weapon’s improved maneuverability.The first test took place from a nuclear submarine — the USS Hampton. The submarine fired a Tomahawk Block IV from its vertical capsule launch system.“The missile flew a pre-planned mission until a strike controller located at a maritime command center directed the Tomahawk to a new target. The missile successfully demonstrated enhanced flex retargeting before striking the updated target at the China Lake weapons range,” a Raytheon statement said.In the second test, the guided missile cruiser  USS Lake Champlain launched a Tomahawk Block IV to the missile’s highest ever altitude, Raytheon officials said.“The Tomahawk flew a series of pre-planned high altitude maneuvers demonstrating improved performance in its flight regime.  The missile completed a pre-planned vertical dive impacting a target on San Nicolas Island off the Southern California coast,” a Raytheon statement said.Navy Tomahawk program manager Capt. Joe Mauser said the “tests validated recent software updates that improve the weapon system flight performance.”Raytheon officials said the tests were merely the latest move in a series of ongoing steps aimed at further upgrading and modernizing the Tomahawk Block IV missile.“We’re constantly trying to provide more value out of the Tomahawk and upgrade its software and hardware. These tests pushed the envelope in terms of maneuvers,” Roy Donelson, Raytheon Tomahawk program manager added.Donelson explained that the test showed what he called enhanced flux in-flight re-targeting wherein the missile can skim along the sea or fly at high altitudes before reaching its target.Overall, Raytheon has delivered more than 3,000 Tomahawk Block IV missiles to the Navy.  The missiles are expected to complete a 30-year service life after being re-certified at the 15-year mark. The inventory of Block IV missiles are slated to go through a re-certification process in 2018 and 2019.Tomahawks have been upgraded numerous times over their years of service. The Block IV Tomahawk, in service since 2004, includes a two-way data link for in-flight re-targeting, terrain navigation, digital scene-matching cameras and a high-grade inertial navigation system, said Donelson.The weapon is also capable of performing battle damage assessment missions by relaying images through a data link, he said.The re-certification process for Block IV Tomahawks will provide occasion to implement a series of high-tech upgrades to the missile platform which improve the weapon’s lethality, guidance and ability to find and destroy moving targets, Donelson explained.With this in mind, Raytheon has been conducting ongoing re-certification studies with the Navy to take up key questions regarding upgrades and new technologies for the platform, Donelson said.Along these lines, the fiscal year 2015 budget also adds $150 million for a new Tomahawk missile navigation and communications suite in order to better enable the weapon to operate in anti-access/area-denial environments, he added.Donelson explained that a number of the current technological upgrade efforts are timed to coincide with the planned re-certification of the inventory of Block IV Tomahawk missiles.Along with the advanced communications and navigation suite, which is planned to be ready by 2018 or 2019, Raytheon is also developing a new seeker, processor and warhead for the weapon.“With a 30 year service life and a 15 year warranty a lot of these systems will come back in 2018 and 2019 with all the upgrades. Tomahawk will be able to do autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in the future.  We’re looking at supersonic concepts and new payloads,” he said.Among the new payloads is a more-penetrating warhead is called the Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System, or JMEWS. It was recently sponsored by U.S. Central Command. The JMEWS would give the Tomahawk better bunker buster type effects — meaning it could enable the weapon to better penetrate hardened structures like concrete.Donelson said that Raytheon is conducting JMEWS risk-reduction testing with the Navy and hopes to enter into a new development phase by next year.Testing analyzed the ability of the programmable warhead to integrate onto the most advanced Block IV Tomahawk missile, a weapon which can loiter over targets, send back single frame images and change course in flight via a GPS guidance system.Donelson explained that Raytheon is also working on new passive and active seeker technology for the Tomahawk which would even better enable the weapon to discriminate between targets and destroy moving targets.A passive seeker can receive an electromagnetic signal and follow it, whereas an active seeker has the ability to send out or ping an electronic signal and bounce it off potential targets, he added.Raytheon is planning additional testing for its new seeker system on the weapon, which would allow it to separate legitimate from false targets while on-the-move.After additional lab testing, ground testing and flight testing, an integrate suite consisting of an active seeker, passive seeker and high-speed processor is slated to be ready by 2015, Donelson said.Raytheon has invested $40 million thus far developing the new seeker and processor, and plans another captive carry test of the seeker in coming months, he added.In service for 30 years and having been utilized in 20-years of operational combat, Tomahawks have been the focus of a number of incremental technological improvements ranging from navigation to targeting and data-link upgrades.Also, Raytheon is looking at multi-year contracts with the Navy for future Tomahawk production in order to lower prices. In addition, looking to find additional foreign military sales customers for the Tomahawk is another method of seeking to increase production and therefore lower costs.Tomahawk missiles weigh 3,500 pounds with a booster and can travel at subsonic speeds up to 550 miles per hour at ranges greater than 900 nautical miles. They are just over 18-feet long and have an 8-foot, 9-inch wingspan.The Navy is in the early stages of conducting an analysis of alternatives exploring options for a next-generation land attack weapon. It remains unclear whether they will use next-generation, upgraded Tomahawks to meet this requirement or chose to develop a new system."

Brady completed 23-of-35 for 292 yards and   New  England racked  up 220 yards on  the ground, with Stevan Ridley and Shane   Vereen running for 113 and 90, respectively.&quot;Satisfying night tonight,&quot; said Patriots head coach Bill Belichick.   &quot;Certainly a lot of things we need to do better, but we played hard. We made a   lot of plays against a good football team.&quot;Cincinnati  (3-1)  was the last team  in the NFL  to lose a game after Arizona   fell to the Broncos earlier Sunday.Andy  Dalton passed for 204 yards and two touchdowns, but Cincinnati&apos;s defense   failed  to  live up to the  standards it set  in the previous three games. The   Bengals  gave up  just 33 points in  those three wins before coughing up 43 in   this one.Brady had New England&apos;s offense rolling from the opening possession, which saw   the  hosts march 10 plays for an early TD. Brady hit Brandon LaFell for 20   yards on the first play from scrimmage and connected with Tim Wright for a 30-   yard  pickup later  in the drive. Brady  then extended the series with a QB   keeper  on 4th-and-1,  and  Ridley capped  the trek  with  a 1-yard  touchdown   plunge.&quot;We got off to a great start,&quot; Brady said. &quot;We talked about that all week. It   was a long week for everybody, so we wanted to start fast.&quot;Star  cornerback Darrelle  Revis made  a  diving interception  on the  ensuing   Bengals  possession,  but offsetting  penalties negated  the pick. Mike Nugent   missed short on a 52-yard field goal later in the drive.Brady  kept the  momentum going  following  the missed  kick, leading  another   touchdown  drive with  a little help from his tight ends. Rob Gronkowski&apos;s 27-   yard  reception  led to Brady&apos;s touchdown  pass to Wright, who absorbed a blow   from a defender and fell just over the goal line.Nugent  and Stephen  Gostkowski swapped field goals in the second quarter, and   the Patriots were set to take a 17-3 lead at halftime, but a mistake by one of   Cincinnati&apos;s best players led to more New England points.After  Gostkowski hit  his 48-yard kick, the  Bengals took over at their own 9   just  over  a minute before  halftime. Dalton connected  with A.J. Green for a   19-yard  catch,  but Revis jarred  the ball loose as  he was bringing Green to   the  ground. Jamie  Collins recovered the fumble, and New England got the ball   back.Cincinnati  held its  ground, but Gostkowski kicked a short field goal to make   it 20-3.Adam Jones returned a punt 47 yards early in the third quarter and on the very   next  play, Dalton and Mohamed Sanu connected on a 37-yard touchdown pass that   cut Cincinnati&apos;s deficit in half.The  Patriots  struck right back, stealing  back momentum with two scores in a   matter  of minutes  to essentially seal the outcome. Brady hit Gronkowski from   16  yards  out to cap  an 86-yard touchdown drive  and on the ensuing kickoff,   Kyle Arrington recovered former Patriot Brandon Tate&apos;s fumble and flipped over   the goal line to make it 34-10.Revis,  who spent the  bulk of his time on the field shadowing Green, left the   field  with a minor hamstring injury on the next Bengals drive and Dalton went   right to Green for a 17-yard score.Gostkowski  kicked three  more field  goals  in the  fourth to  round out  the   scoring.Game NotesThe  Patriots  have won 11 straight  home games and 32 straight regular season   home  games  against AFC teams  ... New  England has won  five of the last six   meetings ... Brady became the sixth quarterback in league history to throw for   50,000  yards  midway through the  first quarter ...

They led 20-3 at halftime before the Bengals (3-1) cut it to 10 points on Andy Dalton&apos;s 37-yard pass to Mohamed Sanu.              But Cincinnati came no closer and became the last team to lose a game this season. The Arizona Cardinals also began the day at 3-0, but lost to the Denver Broncos.              The Bengals were coming off a bye and had trailed for just 48 seconds in their first three games. But they never led Sunday as Ridley scored just 4:57 into the game.              Stephen Gostkowski added five field goals, the most in his nine-year career.              Brady hadn&apos;t thrown for more than 249 yards this season but topped that as he completed 23 of 35 passes. His 27-yard completion to Rob Gronkowski put him over the 50,000-yard mark and he connected for Wright&apos;s touchdown on the next play.              The fans then chanted &quot;Bra-dee! Bra-dee!&quot; They shouted it again when the Patriots began a drive early in the second quarter.              Brady boosted his total to 50,232. John Elway is fifth with 51,475.              &quot;It was a long week. We dug deep. (I&apos;m) proud of everybody,&quot; Brady said.              Dalton was 15 of 24 for 204 yards and was sacked for the first time this season when Chris Jones tackled him 3 minutes into the fourth quarter. Dalton&apos;s second touchdown pass, a 17-yarder to A.J. Green made it 34-17.              But the Bengals lost three fumbles and failed to convert their seven third-down plays.              &quot;If you turn the ball over and don&apos;t make any third downs, you have a chance to have this happen to you,&quot; Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said.              The Patriots were surrounded by doubters after the rout in Kansas City. Was Brady no longer one of the NFL&apos;s top quarterbacks? Did he have enough talented players around him —  a rebuilt offensive line and mediocre receivers  —  to help him?              For one night, at least, he did.              &quot;We don&apos;t sit around listening to what everybody else says,&quot; Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. &quot;We try to do the best we can.&quot;              Brady was sacked just once and completed his first two passes, 20 yards to Brandon LaFell and 30 yards to Wright, who had his best game since being acquired from Tampa Bay just before the season for six-time Pro Bowl guard Logan Mankins.              Not a bad start for a quarterback who had led the Patriots to only 46 points in the previous 14 quarters.              Brady got plenty of help from his defense, which allowed just 121 yards in the first half, and his special teams as Kyle Arrington scored on a 9-yard return after recovering Brandon Tate&apos;s fumble on a kickoff. That made it 34-10 just 6 seconds after Brady&apos;s 16-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski.              ___              AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"

Baltimore  finished off  an eye-opening sweep of the Detroit Tigers with a 2-1   Game 3 win on Sunday.The  Royals hit 95 homers during the year, but won the first two games of this   series  on  the  strength  of  two extra-inning  home  runs.  After  Moustakas   delivered  an  11th inning home run  to carry Kansas City  to a win in Game 1,   Hosmer  gave  the Royals  the lead  on Friday with  a two-run  home run in the   11th.&quot;Well,  you know, it was huge. Won us two games,&quot; said Royals manager Ned Yost   of  the power hitting. &quot;Coming into this game, we were hitting .162 as a team,   they  were hitting  .141, but the difference  were the two big home runs. That   gave us the edge. Tonight the power was huge again.&quot;Kansas  City&apos;s  first playoff  appearance since  1985 started  with a 9-8, 12-   inning  victory  over the Oakland Athletics  in the wild-card game on Tuesday.   The Royals became the first team in major league history to win three-straight   extra-inning games to open a postseason.James  Shields (1-0), who got a no-decision in the wild-card game, gave up two   runs  on  six hits  while striking out  six over six  innings for Kansas City,   which will travel to Baltimore for Game 1 of the ALCS on Friday.Alex  Gordon  knocked in  three runs  for the  Royals, who  have now won seven   straight postseason games dating to Game 5 of the 1985 World Series.Mike  Trout  and Albert Pujols  homered for the  Angels, who ended the regular   season with the best record in baseball.&quot;Well,  right  now it&apos;s tough.  It stings. You  know, we&apos;re all feeling this,&quot;   said  Angels  manager Mike  Scioscia.  &quot;We  expected  better results,  but  as   disappointing  as the series  was and is right now with us, those guys in that   clubhouse had a terrific season.&quot;Los  Angeles  starter C.J.

Alcides  Escobar  then singled, moved  to second on  a wild pitch, advanced to   third on Aoki&apos;s single and crossed the plate on Cain&apos;s sacrifice fly.Cain  then made two  great defensive plays in the fifth.

New  Orleans (2-3) was on the verge of another debilitating loss    after getting embarrassed  last Sunday night  in Dallas by 21 points, but Drew    Brees and the offense  made  enough big plays  down the stretch  to extend New    Orleans&apos;  home  winning streak  to 10  games. Pierre  Thomas totaled 112 yards    from  scrimmage and  scored both  on  the ground  and through  the air,  while    Brees  overcame  a  three-interception  performance with  371  yards  and  two    touchdowns  on 35-of-57  attempts.  Mike  Glennon, trying  to  lead Tampa  Bay    (1-4)   to   a  second  straight  victory,   threw  for  249  yards  with  two    touchdowns  and an interception in the setback, the club&apos;s sixth straight loss    against its division rival.Final Score: Dallas 20, Houston 17 (OT)Arlington,  TX (SportsNetwork.com) - Dan Bailey kicked a 49-yard field goal in   overtime  to lift  the Dallas  Cowboys  to a  20-17 victory  over the  Houston   Texans. The Texans scored the last 10 points of regulation, but were forced to   punt  on the  opening  possession of  the  extra session.  Dez  Bryant made  a   spectacular  37-yard reception  along  the left  sideline  on Dallas&apos;  ensuing   touch to set up Bailey&apos;s boot.Final Score: Pittsburgh 17, Jacksonville 9Jacksonville,   FL  (SportsNetwork.com)  -  Ben  Roethlisberger  threw  for  a   touchdown  and Brice  McCain returned an interception 22 yards for a touchdown   as the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 17-9, on Sunday.   Roethlisberger  was 26-of-36 for 273 yards, throwing to 11 different receivers   in  the  win. Antonio Brown  caught five catches  for 84 yards, Michael Palmer   hauled  in a  touchdown pass and Heath  Miller had three catches for 46 yards.   Le&apos;Veon  Bell  rushed for 82  yards on 15  carries for Pittsburgh (3-2), which   bounced  back  from a 27-24  loss to Tampa Bay  last week. Blake Bortles threw   for  191 yards  on 22-of-36  passing with  two interceptions  and Josh  Scobee   made  three  field goals for  the Jaguars (0-5),  who have lost three straight   games to the Steelers.Final Score: Philadelphia 34, St. Louis 28Philadelphia,  PA (SportsNetwork.com)  - The  Eagles&apos; offense  was once  again   contained  to  pedestrian levels, but  touchdowns on defense and special teams   helped  Philadelphia hold off the St. Louis Rams, 34-28, in Week 5 action. The   Eagles  (4-1)  relied on a  defense that forced  three turnovers and a special   teams  unit that  scored  on a  blocked  punt for  the  second straight  week.   Defensive end Cedric Thornton recovered two fumbles, picking up one in the end   zone and returning another 40 yards to set up a Jeremy Maclin touchdown catch.   Nick  Foles threw a  pair of touchdown passes but finished with just 207 yards   with  an interception  and a lost fumble for Philadelphia, which was outgained   466-352  one week after being held without an offensive touchdown in a loss to   the 49ers. The  Rams (1-3)  scored the  final  21 points  and  moved the  ball   just  past  midfield in  the  final  minute, but  two  dropped  passes and  an   incompletion  on fourth down spoiled a chance at a miraculous comeback. Austin   Davis   came  on   strong   late  and   passed  for   375   yards  and   three   touchdowns, two going to Brian Quick.Final Score: Buffalo 17, Detroit 14Detroit,  MI (SportsNetwork.com) - Dan Carpenter hit a 58-yard field goal with   just  four seconds  to play and the  Buffalo Bills pulled off a 17-14 win over   the  Detroit  Lions.  Kyle  Orton,  making his  first  start  for  Buffalo  in   place  of  a benched  EJ  Manuel,  threw for  308  yards  and a  touchdown  on   30-of-43  passing with  an interception  for the  Bills (3-2),  who snapped  a   two-game  losing  streak.  Matthew  Stafford went  18-for-31  for  221  yards,   one  touchdown  and one  interception for  the Lions (3-2),  who had won their   previous two games. Golden Tate caught seven passes for 134 yards and a score.Final Score: NY Giants 30, Atlanta 20East  Rutherford,  NJ (SportsNetwork.com)  - Odell  Beckham Jr.&apos;s first career   touchdown  catch  highlighted a second-half  surge that propelled the New York   Giants  to a  30-20  victory  over the  Atlanta  Falcons  at MetLife  Stadium.   Beckham&apos;s  15-yard grab of  an Eli Manning fade attempt with 10:02 to play was   part  of a 20-point swing that brought New York (3-2) back from a 20-10 third-   quarter  deficit  to post  its  third  consecutive  win. Fellow  rookie  Andre   Williams  added a  touchdown run  during  the rally,  while Manning  connected   with  Rueben Randle for a scoring strike earlier and finished with 200 passing   yards  and  no turnovers on  a 19-of-30  completion rate. Beckham, the Giants&apos;   first-round  pick  of the 2014 draft  who sat out  the first four games with a   hamstring  injury,  had 44  yards on  four receptions  in his debut. Williams,   pressed  into an  extended role when Rashad Jennings sprained his left knee in   the  third quarter,  totaled 65 yards on  20 carries. Julio Jones hauled in 11   Matt Ryan passes for 105 yards and Antone Smith had a 74-yard  touchdown catch   for  Atlanta  (2-3), but  the Falcons&apos;  offense went cold  down the stretch en   route  to the club&apos;s 10th loss in its last 11 on the road. Ryan ended 29-of-45   for 316 yards with one touchdown and an interception.Final Score: Indianapolis 20, Baltimore 13Indianapolis,  IN (SportsNetwork.com) - Andrew Luck passed for a touchdown and   ran  for another score, as the Indianapolis Colts overcame four turnovers in a   20-13  victory over  the Baltimore Ravens at Lucas Oil Stadium. Luck connected   on  32-of-49  passes for 312  yards, but was  picked off twice. Ahmad Bradshaw   rushed for 68  yards, but his  fumble inside two minutes left nearly  cost the   game  for  the Colts  (3-2),  who  have won  their  last  three contests.  Joe   Flacco  finished  22-of-38 for 235  yards with  an interception for the Ravens   (3-2),  whose three-game  winning streak was broken. Baltimore turned the ball   over three times.Final Score: Cleveland 29, Tennessee 28Nashville, TN (SportsNetwork.com) - Brian Hoyer&apos;s second touchdown pass of the   fourth quarter to Travis Benjamin was the go-ahead score with 1:09 left in the   contest,  as  the Cleveland Browns  rallied from a 25-point first-half deficit   to  claim  a 29-28 victory  over the Tennessee Titans  in Week 5 action. Hoyer   ended  the day 21-of-37  for 292 yards, three TDs and one interception for the   Browns  (2-2),  while Taylor  Gabriel posted  95 yards  on four receptions and   Benjamin  contributed 48 yards  on four grabs. Ben Tate picked up 123 yards on   22  carries  and Tank Carder  was responsible  for a blocked-punt safety early   in  the  fourth  quarter  that stoked  Cleveland&apos;s  comeback  effort.  Charlie   Whitehurst  was  13-of-21 for 194  yards and two  scores for the Titans (1-4),   who  lost starter Jake Locker in the second quarter with a hand injury. Locker   completed  8-of-11  attempts for  79  yards  and threw  the  first  of two  TD   receptions  from Kendall Wright while also posting a rushing touchdown. Justin   Hunter  added a 75-yard scoring catch, while Wright ended with 47 yards on six   catches.Final Score: Carolina 31, Chicago 24Charlotte, NC (SportsNetwork.com) - Greg Olsen&apos;s second touchdown catch of the   game  late in the fourth quarter led the Carolina Panthers to a 31-24 win over   the  Chicago  Bears on  Sunday. Olsen had  six catches for  72 yards while Cam   Newton  went  19-for-35 for 255 yards  with two touchdowns and an interception   while also losing a fumble for the Panthers (3-2), who ended a two-game slide.   Matt  Forte had 12  catches for 105 yards and a score, while adding 17 carries   for 61 yards for the Bears (2-3), but had a late fumble that led to Carolina&apos;s   winning   score.   Jay   Cutler   went   28-for-36   with   289   yards,   two   touchdowns  and two  interceptions, adding  a touchdown  on the  ground and  a   lost fumble for Chicago, which has lost its last two games.Final Score: Denver 41, Arizona 20Denver, CO (SportsNetwork.com) - Peyton Manning said Wednesday that getting to   the  500-touchdown  mark was just  &quot;the other thing.&quot; He  got the best of both   worlds on Sunday. Manning  threw his 500th touchdown pass in the first quarter   and  finished  with four TD  tosses in the Denver  Broncos&apos; 41-20 win over the   Arizona  Cardinals.  Manning hooked up  with tight end  Julius Thomas for a 7-   yard score on 3rd-and-goal  at  the 4:43 mark of  the opening frame to  get to   the  500 milestone.  He gave a mini fist pump following the touchdown. Manning   finished    31-of-47   for   479   yards   with   two   interceptions,   while   Demaryius  Thomas  had eight  receptions for  a career-high  226 yards and two   touchdowns  for  Denver (3-1), which  outscored Arizona  17-0 in the fourth to   pull  away.  The five-time  MVP Manning  joined Brett Favre  as the only other   quarterback  to  eclipse  500  touchdown  passes.  Favre  holds  the  all-time   record  with  508 TD tosses.  Manning is five  touchdowns away from tying him.   Manning  reached  the milestone in his  244th career game, while it took Favre   293  contests to reach 500. Marvin Harrison has caught the most TD passes from   Manning  with 112, followed by Reggie Wayne with 67. The 38-year-old fired 399   of those TD passes in Indianapolis and currently has 104 with the Broncos.Final Score: San Francisco 22, Kansas City 17Santa  Clara,  CA (SportsNetwork.com) - Phil  Dawson made five field goals and   the  49ers  spoiled Kansas City Chiefs  quarterback Alex Smith&apos;s return to San   Francisco  with a  22-17  victory.  Trailing by  five,  Smith  and the  Chiefs   started  from  their own  20  with  2:12 left  and  no  timeouts. Perrish  Cox   prevented  Smith from leading Kansas City down  the  field for  a game-winning   score,  as  he  picked  off  the  2005 No.  1  overall  pick.  Smith  was  San   Francisco&apos;s  starting quarterback  until he  suffered a  concussion in  a game   against  St.  Louis in  Week 10 of  the 2012 season.  Colin Kaepernick won the   starting job from there, and Smith was traded to the Chiefs in 2013.Final Score: San Diego 31, NY Jets 0San  Diego,  CA (SportsNetwork.com) -  Philip Rivers  passed for 288 yards and   three touchdowns before being rested late, and the San Diego Chargers trounced   an  inept  New York  Jets squad,  31-0, on  Sunday afternoon. Rivers completed   20-of-28 attempts and threw  a pair of first-half scores to Antonio  Gates for   the  Chargers  (4-1), who  pitched their  first shutout  since a similar score   against  Kansas City  on Dec.  12, 2010.  Branden Oliver  posted 182  yards of   total  offense and  two  touchdowns  including a  game-best  114  yards on  19   carries,  with  Gates contributing 60 yards  on four receptions. The tandem of   Geno  Smith  and Michael  Vick combined  to go  13-of-32 for  74 yards and one   interception  for the Jets (1-4), whose point total has decreased with each of   their four straight defeats.Final Score: New England 43, Cincinnati 17Foxboro,  MA (SportsNetwork.com)  - The narrative leading up to Sunday night&apos;s   game  was that the Cincinnati Bengals were the team to beat in the AFC and the   New  England  Patriots had fallen off.  The message, as always, is never count   out  Tom  Brady. Brady threw two  touchdown passes and the Patriots routed the   previously-unbeaten  Bengals,  43-17,  at  Gillette  Stadium.  Coming  off  an   underwhelming triumph over the winless Raiders and a crushing defeat in Kansas   City,  the Patriots  (3-2) got back on  track with a statement win in front of   their home fans. Brady completed 23-of-35 for 292 yards and New England racked   up  220 yards  on the ground, with  Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen running for   113  and  90, respectively. Cincinnati  (3-1) was the last  team in the NFL to   lose  a  game after  Arizona fell  to the Broncos  earlier Sunday. Andy Dalton   passed  for  204 yards and two  touchdowns, but Cincinnati&apos;s defense failed to   live  up to the standards it set in the previous three games. The Bengals gave   up just 33 points in those three wins before coughing up 43 in this one.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2Final Score: Green Bay 42, Minnesota 10Green  Bay, WI  (SportsNetwork.com) - Aaron Rodgers threw for three touchdowns   to  lead the  Green Bay Packers to  a 42-10 victory over the Minnesota Vikings   at  Lambeau  Field.  Rodgers  finished  with 156  passing  yards  on  12-of-17   efficiency  and  Eddie Lacy  had  a  season-high  105  rushing yards  and  two   touchdowns  on 13  carries for the Packers  (3-2), who were coming off a 38-17   win  over Chicago  last  week. Jordy  Nelson had  a  66-yard touchdown  catch,   while  Davante  Adams and Randall  Cobb also  caught a scoring pass. Christian   Ponder rushed for a touchdown and completed 22 of his 44 passes for 222  yards   and  two  interceptions  for  Minnesota  (2-3),  which  was  without  starting   quarterback Teddy Bridgewater due to a sprained left ankle. Matt Asiata rushed   15 times for 72 yards and Adam Thielen had 57 yards on four catches in defeat."

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa) (The Associated Press)PreviousNextHAVANA –  The ball bounced off the pavement and Yordeni Caballero swung, whacking it with a soft thud and hurling his bat to the side as if he&apos;d hit a homerun. As the 7-year-old raced down a street-turned-cricket pitch, his coach shouted instructions about a sport that&apos;s barely known in Cuba.              The Caribbean is divided between baseball-playing countries with U.S. ties and cricket-playing islands that once belonged to the British Empire. Nowhere is more baseball-crazy than Cuba, but even here, a tiny but passionate group of men is trying to win people over to cricket, baseball&apos;s slower-paced, more courtly British relative.              Mostly descendants of sugar-cane workers who migrated from other islands in the early 20th century, Cuba&apos;s cricket partisans subsist on homemade and donated equipment from the embassies of cricket-playing countries. They recruit players from the streets and teach them rules of the new sport, while exploiting baseball-honed skills such as batting and running bases.              The offspring of immigrants from the  island of Martinique, Kiomai Aguiar said he played baseball and basketball as a child, then switched to cricket at 16, falling in love with its leisurely pace and courtly interactions between players. He now coaches Caballero and other youths playing pickup games in San Miguel del Padron on the outskirts of Havana              &quot;It&apos;s a game that forces you to think, to organize, to do things deliberately. At the same time there&apos;s respect and unity among the players,&quot; said Aguiar, a 35-year-old unemployed maintenance worker.  &quot;There&apos;s not a single cricket pitch in Cuba, so we play where they let us, on a soccer field, a baseball field, a running track.&quot;              Cuba has organized cricket in six of its 16 provinces, with 1,150 registered players throughout the country of 11 million, said Barbara Delarra, an official with Cuba&apos;s National Sports Institute.              &quot;Youngsters like it because it&apos;s similar to baseball, with pitching, batting and fielding. It&apos;s a new sport and appealing to youngsters frustrated with baseball,&quot; she said.              Cricket is also part of the cultural identity of Caribbean migrant communities in Cuba, the descendants of some 250,000 workers from Jamaica, Dominica and other British colonies who moved to sugar towns in eastern Cuba where they attended Protestant churches, ate spicier food and played cricket.              &quot;They kept a lot of their identity,&quot; said Jorge Giovannetti, chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Puerto Rico and an expert on Caribbean migration to Cuba.  &quot;They kept some of their diet, they kept some of their religious heritage, and cricket is part of it as well.&quot;              Cricket is most deeply rooted in the eastern province of Guantanamo, home to many of Cuba&apos;s immigrant-founded communities, where cricket is frequently taught to children in afterschool athletics programs despite the lack of standard equipment.              &quot;If we don&apos;t have a bat, we make it from a stick. If there&apos;s no ball, we make it from rags,&quot; said Eliecer Brooks, the descendant of Jamaican immigrants who plays for Guatanamo&apos;s cricket team. &quot;We&apos;ve wanted to maintain this tradition because it&apos;s beautiful to remember one&apos;s roots.&quot;              Without a national tournament, Cuba has amateur tournaments like one played on a Havana soccer field last month between three Cuban teams and three teams of students from cricket-playing countries like Pakistan and Sri Lanka.              Adithya Senavirath, a Sri Lankan studying at the Latin American School of Medicine, where foreigners receive free medical education, said he enjoyed playing against Cubans instead of the fellow foreign students he usually faced in cricket.              &quot;The Cubans have skills, they&apos;re good bowlers,&quot; he said. &quot;They lacking some technique, but they learn fast.&quot;              ____              Michael Weissenstein in Havana contributed to this report.              ____              Michael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein"

There&apos;s  different steps during the  season that you have to take and   this is one of them. It&apos;s so hard against a team like Detroit that has a great   pedigree and experience at (the postseason).&quot;Baltimore  will face the upstart Royals, who completed a series sweep over the   Angels  on Sunday  night, in the best-of-seven Championship Series, which will   begin Friday.Price  (0-1), thought  to be the final missing piece to a star-studded Detroit   squad  that had reached  the ALCS in each of the last three years but couldn&apos;t   capture  a World Series title, pitched very well in his first postseason start   since  being acquired  from Tampa Bay at this summer&apos;s trade deadline. The ace   lefty  yielded just  five hits, including Cruz&apos;s go-ahead blast, and two walks   while fanning six over eight solid innings.Norris  (1-0) was  just a little bit better, however, with the righty limiting   the  Tigers&apos; potent  lineup to  a mere  two  hits and  a pair  of walks  while   striking out six through 6 1/3 scoreless innings.&quot;I  don&apos;t  know if  there was a  ton I&apos;d do  differently, quite frankly,&quot; said   Tigers  manager Brad Ausmus  of his team&apos;s lack of offense. &quot;I think Game 2 (a   7-6  comeback win  by Baltimore) was probably  the game that hurt us the most,   obviously, having a lead going to the eighth inning.&quot;He  also benefited  from a  questionable  call in  the second  inning, as  the   Tigers&apos;  Andrew Romine was  ruled out on a bunt attempt that would have scored   Alex Avila from third despite replays showing he may have beat the play, which   was challenged by Ausmus but upheld.Britton  surrendered back-to-back doubles to Victor Martinez and J.D. Martinez   to  begin  the bottom of  the ninth, but bounced  back to induce a game-ending   double-play grounder from Hernan Perez with the winning run on first.Norris,  a somewhat  surprising choice  by Orioles  skipper Buck  Showalter to   start  Game  3, justified  the decision  by successfully challenging Detroit&apos;s   hitters all throughout his stint.He was reached for a double by Avila with one out in the second, however, with   the  Tigers  catcher tagging to  third on Nick  Castellanos&apos; fly ball prior to   Romine dropping down a hard bunt to second that Jonathan Schoop scooped up and   tossed to first with his glove just as the runner reached the bag.After  a nearly  2 1/2-minute review, the  out call stood to take the would-be   run off the board.Detroit  had  another near-miss  in the  bottom of the  third, which Don Kelly   began  with a  single and  later stole  second. Torii  Hunter followed  with a   chopper  to  short in  which Kelly  was caught too  far away  from the bag and   erased for the second out.Orioles  shortstop  J.J. Hardy kept  the inning  alive by throwing away Miguel   Cabrera&apos;s  grounder to  put runners on second and third, but Norris escaped by   getting Victor Martinez to fly out.Price, meanwhile, didn&apos;t allow more than one baserunner in an inning until the   sixth, when Adam Jones singled in front of Cruz&apos;s opposite-field fly ball that   narrowly  cleared  the shortest part  of the  park just inside the right-field   foul pole.The  homer was Cruz&apos;s 16th in postseason play. Eight of them have come in nine   career playoff meetings with Detroit.&quot;He&apos;s  been awesome  all  year,&quot;  said Orioles  right  fielder Nick  Markakis.   &quot;That&apos;s  the main  reason we got him. I  played a lot of games against him and   he&apos;s done a lot of damage against us. I&apos;m just glad he&apos;s on our team doing the   damage now.&quot;Norris  departed  after issuing a one-out  walk to Castellanos in the seventh.   Miller came on to retire the next two hitters, then set down the side in order   in the eighth to keep it a 2-0 game.Britton  wasn&apos;t as  effective in  the ninth,  as Victor  Martinez greeted  the   closer  with a  line drive  that rolled  to  the wall  for a  double and  J.D.   Martinez  crushed an 0-2  pitch into the gap in right center to get the Tigers   on the board.Britton  came  up  with  a  key strikeout  of  Bryan  Holaday,  however,  then   intentionally walked Castellanos to set up Perez&apos;s around-the-horn double-play   ball that sent Detroit&apos;s season of high expectations to a sudden end.Game NotesCruz&apos;s  16 postseason homers ties Carlos Beltran for ninth place on MLB&apos;s all-   time  list.  He hit six in  six games against  Detroit en route to earning MVP   honors  in the 2011 ALCS while with Texas ... Price fell to 0-5 in five career   ALDS  starts ...  Holaday replaced Avila in  the top of the sixth inning after   the latter took a foul ball off his catcher&apos;s mask and was forced to leave the   game ... The Orioles improved to 3-1 overall in Division Series, having bested   Cleveland  in 1996  and Seattle in 1997  and losing to the Yankees in 2012 ...

(AP)A government report released this week blasted the safety procedures for handling radioactive waste at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, following a leak that prompted a shutdown in February.The inspector general of the Department of Energy said a barrel of plutonium-tainted debris was improperly packaged, then shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, N.M.in February to be stored in an underground storage facility a half-mile beneath the surface. Once at WIPP, a salt truck caught on fire underground, causing a chemical reaction inside a waste drum that released trace amounts of americium and plutonium. Some 22 plant employees were contaminated, forcing a shutdown of the facility that is still in effect.According to the DOE, operations at WIPP were suspended and the nation&apos;s only operating deep geologic repository for the permanent disposal of defense-related radioactive waste was shut down for an indefinite period. The shutdown has already cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The DOE projects a 2016 re-opening of the plant.Among the critical points made in the report, the DOE accused the laboratory of permitting the introduction of potentially incompatible materials in waste drums to be stored at WIPP, and a failure of the lab&apos;s safety procedures to prevent this from occurring.&quot;Our review identified several major deficiencies in LANL&apos;s procedures for the development and approval of waste packaging and remediation techniques that may have contributed to the radiological event,&quot; said the report.  &quot;Of particular concern, not all waste management procedures at LANL were properly vetted through the established procedure revision process nor did they conform to established environmental requirements.&quot;There was also concern about how the lab was disposing of volatile mixtures of nitrate salts and organic matter which a 2000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report found to be &quot;inherently hazardous.&quot;The government auditor said the lab should have included an inorganic absorbent material such as kitty litter in the nitrate salt mixture, but that it used organic material instead, ignoring a 2012 report suggesting the more effective and safer method.Even before the Inspector General report was released, there was a personnel shakeup at the lab.&quot;Four top cleanup officials were reassigned by the lab last week and the Department of Energy announced their intention to pull the environmental management portion of the contract with the lab,&quot; according to Lindsey Geisler, spokeswoman for the Department of Energy.The Inspector General report is consistent with many of the waste processing issues already recognized by the Department and the lab, and the Department has already initiated actions to address the underlying issues identified in the report. Laboratory spokesman Matthew Nerzig declined to comment on why safety policies were violated.FoxNews.com&apos;s Joseph J.

While riding on the back of the boat, he captured footage of a large great white shark attacking a significantly smaller white shark.The footage, obtained by Barcroft TV, makes for compelling viewing.Sydney-based Malski, who was on a two-day diving trip, spotted the large shark — given the name “Gilbert” — only hours before. He told the U.K. Mirror that the attack was “surreal.”“I asked the dive master and skipper of the boat what would happen if a smaller shark got in the way of a larger shark,” Malksi said. “The skipper responded, ‘the big shark would take the smaller one down. Literally six seconds later, that amazing scene was witnessed by me, the skipper, and the dive master.”Malski said the attack was something no one on the boat had ever seen before. Malski and his companions were watching the smaller 8.5 foot-long shark take the bait at the side of the boat. Almost as soon as the smaller animal took the bait, Gilbert, looking like it came straight out of a scene from “Jaws,” emerged from the water, sinking its teeth into the smaller shark, the Mirror reports.Great whites are very elusive creatures. Some scientists estimate that massive sharks number less than 10,000 worldwide, and the secretive animals generally avoid fighting for food, according to sharkfacts.org.Since these animals are so rare, Malski said the bizarre out-of-left-field attack was even more fascinating.“I believe that it is extremely rare footage as great whites are elusive and still largely unknown creatures,” Malski told the Mirror.While the event was gruesome to witness firsthand, Malski added that after observing 18 different sharks closely during the expedition, he found the animals to be “inquisitive” and “not aggressive,” in general.“Even when one bumped my hand and camera when I was 20 meters (65.6 feet) underwater, there was no aggression – just inquisitiveness.”At least during this expedition, Gilbert proved to be the exception to the rule. While the large shark has been spotted in the waters near the Neptune Islands since Malski’s footage was recorded, the smaller shark is nowhere to be seen."

Parker | AMNH)A newly discovered 52-million-year-old fossil of an &quot;ant-loving&quot; beetle is the oldest example of its species on record, and may help researchers learn more about this social parasite, a new study finds.Like its descendants living today, the ancient beetle was likely a myrmecophile, a species that depends on ants for survival. The prehistoric beetle probably shared living quarters with ants and benefited from their hard work by eating ant eggs and taking the ants&apos; resources.Other myrmecophiles include the lycaenid butterfly, which lays its eggs in carpenter ants&apos; nests, tricking the ants into caring for their young; and the paussine ground beetle, which also dupes ants by living alongside them as it preys on the ants&apos; young and workers. [The 10 Most Diabolical and Disgusting Parasites]The beetles&apos; and butterflies&apos; shared parasitic behavior suggests that myrmecophily (ant love) is an ancient evolutionary phenomenon, the researchers said. But the fossil record of such creatures is poor, making it unclear how and when this practice arose, they added.The amber-encased beetle, now known as Protoclaviger trichodens, and other stealth beetles began to diversify just as modern ants became more abundant in prehistoric times, the researchers found.&quot;Although ants are an integral part of most terrestrial ecosystems today, at the time that this beetle was walking the Earth, ants were just beginning to take off, and these beetles were right there inside the ant colonies, deceiving them and exploiting them,&quot; beetle specialist and lead researcher Joseph Parker, a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History and postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, said in a statement.There are roughly 370 known beetle species that belong to the Clavigeritaegroup, myrmecophiles that are about 0.04 to 0.12 inches long. But many more myrmecophile beetles are likely awaiting discovery, Parker said.&quot;This tells us something not just about the beetles, but also about the ants their nests were big enough and resource-rich enough to be worthy of exploitation by these super-specialized insects,&quot; Parker explained. &quot;And when ants exploded ecologically and began to dominate, these beetles exploded with them.&quot;Sneaky beetlesThe beetles use a sneaky strategy to bypass the high security surrounding ant nests. Ants rely on pheromones to recognize intruders, which they then dismember and eat. In a feat that continues to mystify scientists, Clavigeritaebeetles are able to pass through this smelling system and participate in colony life. [Mind Control: See Photos of Zombie Ants]&quot;Adopting this lifestyle brings lots of benefits,&quot; Parker said. &quot;These beetles live in a climate-controlled nest that is well protected against predators, and they have access to a great deal of food, including the ants&apos; eggs and brood, and most remarkably, liquid food regurgitated directly to their mouths by the worker ants themselves.&quot;The beetles have evolved to look a certain way to reap these benefits, he said.Clavigeritaebeetles look nothing like their close relatives. The segments within their abdomens and antennas are fused, likely to provide protection against worker ants, which are somehow tricked into carrying the beetles around the nest. Eventually, the worker ants carry the beetles to the brood galleries, where the beetles feast on eggs and larvae, Parker said.The beetles also have recessed mouthparts, which make it easy for them to receive liquid food from worker ants. They also coat their bodies with oily secretions from brushlike glands that may encourage the ants to &quot;adopt&quot; them, in lieu of attacking them. But the chemical makeup of these secretions is unknown.&quot;If you watch one of these beetles interact inside an ant colony, you&apos;ll see the ants running up to it and licking those brushlike structures,&quot; Parker said.Rare beetle findYet it&apos;s rare to encounter Clavigeritaebeetles in the wild, making the new specimen which is possibly the first fossil of this group to be uncovered a valuable find.Researchers named it Protoclaviger trichodens, from the Greek word prtos (&quot;first&quot;) and claviger (&quot;club bearer&quot;). To describe its tufts of hair, the research team used the Greek word trchas (&quot;hair&quot;) and the Latin word dens (&quot;prong&quot;).The fossil, from the Eocene epoch (about 56 million years ago to 34 million years ago), is an amber deposit from what was once a rich rainforest in India. The body may look like that of modern Clavigeritaebeetles, but two hooklike brushes on top of its abdomen, called trichomes, give it a primitive appearance, the researchers said. Also, Protoclaviger&apos;s abdominal segments are still separate, unlike the fused-together segments in today&apos;s beetles.&quot;Protoclaviger is a truly transitional fossil,&quot; Parker said. &quot;It marks a big step along the pathway that led to the highly modified social parasites we see today, and it helps us figure out the sequence of events that led to this sophisticated morphology.&quot;The study was published today Oct. 2 in the journal Current Biology. "

A bullfrog from Billings dissected last year had a robin in its stomach. (AP Photo/U.S. Geological Survey) (The Associated Press)PreviousNextBILLINGS, Mont. –  An invasion of American bullfrogs that will eat just about anything — including each other — is spreading downstream along Montana&apos;s Yellowstone River and poses a potential threat to native frogs, government scientists said Thursday.Bullfrogs were found in recent surveys along a 66-mile stretch of the river from the Laurel area downstream to Custer, said U.S. Geological Survey biologist Adam Sepulveda. The number of breeding sites for the animals almost quadrupled between 2010 and last year, to 45.&quot;They are going to eat anything they can fit into their mounts. It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s another frog or a bird or a mosquito,&quot; said Sepulveda, who co-authored a study on Yellowstone River bullfrogs appearing in the journal Aquatic Invasions.Bullfrogs as long as 12 inches when outstretched have been found. One that was caught and cut open near the Audubon Conservation Center in Billings last year had an oriole in its stomach.State and federal agencies initially tried to stop the invaders in their tracks by killing them all off, but gave up after the number of bullfrogs overwhelmed the effort. They&apos;re now trying to come up with a strategy to at least contain their spread.Bullfrogs are native to the eastern U.S., but are known to have been spread by humans to every state except North Dakota.They&apos;ve caused problems elsewhere by preying on native frogs, out-competing other animals for food, and spreading a fungus that&apos;s suspected as a cause of a widespread decline in amphibians, Sepulveda said.They were first documented in eastern Montana in 1999. Scientists believe they descended from released pet frogs or bullfrog tadpoles used as bait by fishers.Another population recently has been documented in eastern Montana along of a tributary of the Tongue River south of Ashland, according to Sepulveda and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.The frogs have inhabited areas of western Montana since the 1920s, likely from a farming operation that sold their legs to be eaten, Sepulveda said."

The earthquake resulted in more than 300 deaths and damaged many buildings in the nearby area, including the historical St. John the Evangelist church in the village of Casentino. The floor of the church partially collapsed, exposing underground rooms holding mummified human bodies, which included the newfound fetus that dates back to 1840, according to the researchers&apos; estimates.When the researchers examined the fetus mummy using a radiograph, they saw a fetal skeleton that was not fully connected or articulated, which means that some of the bones were not in the exact same position to each other as they likely were when the fetus was alive. They were not able to establish the sex of the fetus, as they could not determine the morphology of its pelvic and jaw bones, which scientists use to identify sexual characteristics of skeletons. The researchers did estimate the fetus was at 29 weeks of development inside its mother&apos;s womb. [See Photos of the Mummy Fetus and Excavation Site]A few features of the mummy suggested that an operation had taken place. The fetus&apos; skull had been dissected in several places and disconnected from the spine, while its arms had been separated from the rest of the body at the joints, none of which typically occurs in the process of post-mortem examinations. All of these characteristics &quot;strongly suggest a case of embryotomy,&quot; which was a procedure that occurred before removing the fetus from the womb, study author Ruggero D&apos;Anastasio of University Museum at University of Chieti, Italy, told Live Science.This likely case of embryotomy &quot;is the only anthropological proof of this surgical practice up to now in this geographical region,&quot; he added.Embryotomy was a common practice in ancient times, D&apos;Anastasio said. The procedure was practiced in Alexandria and then in Rome during the first and second centuries, the researchers wrote in the study. Physicians typically performed it when a mother&apos;s life was threatened due to delivery complications or when the fetus was already thought to be dead in the womb.According to some reports, however, &quot;embryotomy was [also] the most extreme method of abortion during the medieval period,&quot; they wrote.The remains of this fetus had been reassembled to match its anatomic shape, including the fragments of the skull being placed at the top of the mummy inside a headgear. The careful reassembly and dressing of the fetus indicates a high sense of compassion for the death of unborn children within the local community at the time, the researchers said.The other human remains found at the site likely date back to the 19th century or earlier, as confirmed by a scientific method of age determination called radiocarbon dating and information gathered from personal objects. Those items include rings and rosary beads, shoes and clothes, as well as the textiles and shrouds used for wrapping the mummified bodies.Some of the bodies had lesions from autopsy procedures, such as craniotomy, in which a bone flap is removed from the skull to access the brain, according to the report published online Aug. 12 in the International Journal of Osteoarcheology."

She&apos;s sampled dirt from tropical forests to deserts around the world and found it &quot;teeming with so many different types of organisms,&quot; she tells NPR. She also found something pretty unexpected when she and nine other scientists invaded Central Park recently and collected 596 samples of dirt. After extracting the DNA, her team had 167,000 varieties of microbes—count every mammal on the planet then multiply that number by 30—80% of which were unknown to science, the Washington Post reports. As National Geographic puts it, that&apos;s &quot;microbial richness on a scale we can barely understand.&quot; That microbial richness actually isn&apos;t so rare. Essentially, &quot;there&apos;s as much biodiversity in the soils&quot; of Central Park&apos;s 843 acres as Ramirez&apos;s team has found in soils &quot;from the Arctic to Antarctica,&quot; she says. The fact that the study found that soil diversity at &quot;a single urban location matches that observed across natural ecosystems spanning multiple biomes and continents,&quot; however, was surprising. But there&apos;s an explanation. Central Park features numerous plants and animals and has been treated with fertilizer and chemicals.

The man had been taking the supplement for about three weeks, mixing it with water to drink it as a tea and also placing the supplement under the tongue.The case report shows how important it is for patients to tell their doctors if they are taking any supplements, said study author Dr. Maryam Asgari, an investigator at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research in Oakland, California. [The Truth About Herbal Supplements for Stress]The man might have been particularly susceptible to experiencing such an adverse reaction from kava kava because he was also taking an anti-anxiety drug called citalopram (sold under the brand name Celexa), according the case report. Kava kava is broken down by the same enzyme system as citalopram, and so taking both may have worsened the man&apos;s adverse reaction to the supplement.The case also shows that doctors should take detailed histories of their patients&apos; use of supplements, because supplements may interfere with the medications people take, Asgari told Live Science.In the man&apos;s case, the doctors treated his rash and told him to stop taking kava kava, and the rash went away after nine days of treatment. But then the man started taking the supplement again, and his face became flushed and itchy, although no rash occurred this time. After this episode, he stopped taking kava kava completely and the rash didn&apos;t return.Kava kava is derived from a native western Pacific Islands plant called Piper methysticum, which is believed to have pain-relieving, relaxant and anti-anxiety properties, the researchers wrote in the study.It is not clear how many people may be using kava kava, as many doctors do not ask their patients about supplement use in general, Asgari said.The patient in the case report had a history of depression, anxiety, high blood pressure and high levels of fat or cholesterol in his blood. He had been taking anti-anxiety medication for several months, and medication for high pressure for several years.The investigators determined that kava kava probably affected the man&apos;s sebaceous glands, which are the oil-producing glands of the skin, and are typically concentrated in the areas of his body where the rash appeared.Previous reports have described other adverse reactions to kava kava, Asgari added.Some of those reactions have included skin inflammation and rash. With more excessive kava kava use, problems such as liver damage, kidney dysfunction, malnutrition, weight loss and alterations in blood cells and platelets have been reported, the researchers wrote.The case report was published online Sept. 12 in the journal Clinical and Experimental Dermatology.Copyright 2014 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

The iridescent sheen directs beams of sunlight into the interior of the clam, providing light for algae housed inside.In a symbiotic return, the algae use that sunlight to power photosynthesis, resulting in energy for the giant clam. &quot;It ends up being a large part of the energy budget of the clams,&quot; said study researcher Alison Sweeney, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania.Essentially, the oversize mollusks, which can measure more than 4 feet long, have a natural solar energy system hiding in their shells.Most iridescent cells including those that impart a vivid blue to the morpho butterfly, the glittery colors of beetles and the shine of birds&apos; feathers are dead, much like fingernails and human hair. But the iridescent cells of squid and giant clams are alive. [Marine Marvels: Spectacular Photos of Sea Creatures]So, the researchers wondered, &quot;What on Earth is a giant clam doing with a living iridescent cell?&quot; Sweeney said.Giant clams have a dull outer shell, as well as a weighted shell hinge that helps them point their lips up toward the sunlight. Perhaps the iridescent cells, called iridocytes, play an optical function, the researchers reasoned.The team traveled to Palau, an island east of the Philippines in the tropical Pacific Ocean, to gather information about the giant clams. &quot;We put this into a computer model about how we think light propagates through the clams,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;[But] nobody actually believed it,&quot; she added, referring to how the light was reflected back into the shells of the clams.So, they returned to Palau to take detailed measurements of light inside the clams Tridacna derasa, T. maxima and T. crocea with the help of a fiber-optic probe. The iridescent cells reflected a remarkable amount of light into the clam, more than the scientists had initially expected, Sweeney said. Clam tissue with iridocytes has about fivefold more particles of light, called photons, deep inside the tissue than clam tissue without iridocytes does, they found.&quot;We&apos;re very excited by our surprising discovery,&quot; said study researcher Dan Morse, a professor of biomolecular science and engineering, and director of the Marine Biotechnology Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara.&quot;The brilliantly reflective cells of the giant clam actually redirect photons from sunlight deeper into the clam&apos;s tissue, gently and uniformly illuminating millions of symbiotic algae that live there, so they can provide nutrients to their animal host by photosynthesis,&quot; Morse wrote in an email to Live Science.The algae&apos;s configuration is also efficient, the researchers found. If the algae were spread horizontally across the clam&apos;s tissue, only the top layers of algae would get light. The giant clam, however, doesn&apos;t have this obstacle. Instead, the algae are piled into vertical columns that allow the reflective cells to shine light along the sides of the columns not just the algae on top.The reflected light is also less intense than direct sunlight, so the algae don&apos;t get fried, Sweeney said.The study is &quot;very interesting,&quot; Euichi Hirose, a professor of invertebrate biology at the University of the Ryukyus in Japan, told Live Science in an email.&quot;Now, we know the giant-clam mantle has a more sophisticated function than we expected,&quot; said Hirose, who was not involved in the current study. &quot;The colorful mantle reflects useless light for photosynthesis (green and yellow) and scatters useful light (red and blue) forward, and laterally,into deep tissue.&quot;The giant clams&apos; colorful and sparkly sheen may one day inspire new forms of clean technology, the researchers said. For instance, traditional solar cells work well in direct sunlight, but not when they get too hot. With the clam&apos;s design, a reflective sheen could help solar cells stay cool even when they&apos;re exposed to intense sunlight, Sweeney said.The study was published Sept. 30 in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. "

Archaeologists have discovered &quot;instability over quite a wide area&quot; of the Acropolis, the flat-topped rock that holds the weight of the ancient structure, news.com.au reports, citing Greek news outlet ANA. Archaeologists investigating the site after a rock of &quot;considerable size&quot; fell in January found the fault, which they now blame on rainwater pipes from an old Acropolis museum. The scientists say plenty of restoration work will need to be added to that already being completed at Greece&apos;s most-visited tourist destination. Restoration work has been ongoing at the site despite Greece&apos;s recent trudge through a recession with the unemployment rate at 27%, the International Business Times reports.

Shurbagy, a company hired to restore the 4,600-year-old Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara, is instead destroying it, say activists, who argue Shurbagy has built new walls and structures at the site in clear disregard of preservation laws that limit new construction to less than 5% of the restored structure.

Israel says east Jerusalem is part of its capital and considers Jewish housing developments there to be neighborhoods of the city, but the international community, including the U.S., does not recognize Israel&apos;s annexation of the area and considers construction there to be illegitimate settlement activity.In a striking public rebuke last week, the Obama administration warned Israel that the new project would distance Israel from &quot;even its closest allies&quot; and raise questions about its commitment to seeking peace with Palestinians.Netanyahu, in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” called the administration’s condemnation of the project “baffling.”&quot;It&apos;s against the American values. And it doesn&apos;t bode well for peace,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea that we&apos;d have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, I think it&apos;s anti-peace.&quot;However, Netanyahu said he supported the Obama administration’s decision to launch airstrikes in the battle against the Islamic State, and that Israel is ready to help the U.S. in “every way that we&apos;re asked.”Netanyahu said he believes the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Hamas and Iran are all locked in a competition to be the dominant militant Islamist group in the Middle East. He said the greatest threat to both the U.S. and Israel is the possibility that one of the groups could “marry their mad ideologies to weapons of mass death.”&quot;ISIS has got to be defeated because it&apos;s doing what all these militant Islamists are trying to do. They all want to first dominate their part of the Middle East, and then go on for their twisted idea of world domination,&quot; Netanyahu said. “The difference between ISIS and Hamas and ISIS and Iran and so on is they all agree that the world should be an Islamist hill, but ... each of them wants to be the king of the hill.&quot;Netanyahu also spoke positively about his sometimes testy relationship with Obama, saying he has a good working relationship with the president.&quot;I don&apos;t want to say like an old married couple, but the president said that we had-- he&apos;s had more meetings with me than with any other foreign leader,” he said. “And I think you get to a point of mutual respect.

The group subcontracted with United Labor Unions Local 100, which, according to Cause of Action, paid members less than it billed the government and, in some cases, paid them to recruit union members. The watchdog group discovered the alleged discrepancy in court papers filed by union workers suing the labor organization for unpaid overtime. “Southern United Neighborhoods and ULU Local 100, both rebranded ACORN entities, present a risk of violating the law – this time by potentially misusing over $1.3 million of taxpayer dollars for union activities instead of enrolling individuals in the Affordable Care Act,” Daniel Epstein, executive director for Cause of Action said to FoxNews.com.Epstein and his group sent a letter to the federal Health and Human Services Inspector General this week asking that SUN and the union be investigated for fraud.“Given the amount of federal dollars at issue, the Inspector General should investigate SUN and conduct an audit into the potential misuse of ACA navigator funds,” read the letter.Cause of Action discovered the alleged fraud after stumbling across a class action lawsuit recently filed in June in a Houston court by former SUN worker Cedric Anthony, who is seeking damages against SUN and Local 100 for unpaid overtime.“Plaintiff [Cedric Anthony] was initially hired to work for SOUTHERN UNITED NEIGHBORHOODS,” reads the allegation in the court filing. “Once Plaintiff began working for SOUTHERN UNITED NEIGHBORHOODS as a federal navigator assisting people with the Affordable Care Act, he was directed to also perform work for Local 100 by visiting schools to speak with cafeteria workers to sign up for the union.”Epstein says that SUN, which was formerly a branch of the now-defunct ACORN, and Local 100 likely violated federal law and that it should be worrisome that the union groups have personal information of those who signed up for ObamaCare.“They have to comply with federal regulations,” he said. “First, as ACORN, they had our voter information. Now as SUN they have our healthcare info as well.”Officials for SUN did not immediately return requests for comment.The class action filing also suggests that Anthony and other workers were often forced to work over time of up to 55 hours a week but were never compensated for the overtime work. Since the June filing, at least four other former SUN employees have joined the class action with the same allegations.Officials for Cause of Action also said that they to have spoken with another former Local 100 worker who alleges that some employees worked less than 40 hours per week, but were told to inflate their hours in order for the union to obtain more money from available government funding."

However, he said American citizens have the right to freely enter and exit the U.S.“Ultimately, an American citizen, unless their passport is revoked, is entitled to come back,” Comey told CBS. “So someone who has fought with (Islamic State) with an American passport and wants to come back, we will track them very carefully.”Comey said he would describe the terrorist networks in Syria as a &quot;metastasis of Al Qaeda,&quot; in particular Al-Nusra and the Islamic State.&quot;They are both vicious,  sort of the inheritors of a lot of the mantle of Al Qaeda and present different threats in a lot of ways,&quot; he said.However, Comey said currently the U.S. is not in as dangerous a time as when Al Qaeda was at its peak, because the intelligence community is &quot;better organized.&quot;&quot;We’re better organized and equipped at the border,&quot; he said. &quot;We have relationships with our foreign partners. All of which make us better able to see dots and connect dots. The transformation since before 9/11 is striking.&quot; Comey also said that the Khorasan Group, the terrorist organization in Syria that was targeted in U.S. military strikes last month, is a &quot;serious&quot; group bent on harming the U.S. The Obama administration has been under fire after it was accused of coining a new name for an old nemesis by dubbing an Al Qaeda offshoot “The Khorasan Group&quot; to avoid invoking the name Al Qaeda. &quot;Khorasan was working and you know, may still be working on an effort to attack the United States or our allies, and looking to do it very, very soon,&quot; Comey said. &quot;I can’t sit here and tell you whether it’s their plan is tomorrow or three weeks or three months from now. Given our visibility we know they’re serious people, bent on destruction. And so we have to act as if it’s coming tomorrow.&quot; Comey also addressed cyber crime, calling it a looming threat about which most Americans are not wary. He said Chinese hackers target the intellectual property of U.S. companies in China every day.&quot;I liken them a bit to a drunk burglar. They&apos;re kickin&apos; in the front door, knocking over the vase, while they&apos;re walking out with your television set. They&apos;re just prolific. Their strategy seems to be: &apos;We&apos;ll just be everywhere all the time. And there&apos;s no way they can stop us,&apos;&quot; Comey said.The Justice Department earlier this year announced a 31-count indictment against Chinese hackers accused of breaking into computer networks at steel companies and the manufacturers of solar and nuclear technology, with the goal of gaining a competitive advantage. China has denied the allegations.Comey said one of his top priorities is to improve the agency’s capability against such cyber crimes as ID theft and industrial espionage. The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Your foot, your hand, your arm, your leg … your peace of mind. A part of you was gone.”Though the president made clear that America’s sometimes unfulfilled obligation to veterans dates back to the Revolutionary War, his comments came just months after revelations about backlogs at Veterans Affairs hospitals that resulted in staffers creating bogus waiting lists to conceal the extent of the delays.Obama&apos;s remarks also came in the aftermath of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and amid concerns that the United States will send combat troops into Iraq and Syria to destroy the Islamic State.    &quot;This memorial is a challenge to all of us, a reminder of the obligations this country is under,” Obama said to the estimated crowd of 3,100. “If we are to truly honor these veterans, we must heed the voices that speak to us here. Let&apos;s never rush into war, because it is America&apos;s sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives. Let us only send them into harm&apos;s way when it&apos;s absolutely necessary.&quot;The memorial was organized by philanthropist Lois Pope, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown and Art Wilson, who retired as chief executive and national adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans organization in 2013. The group first started work on creating the granite-and-steel monument in the late 1990s and raised more than $80 million for its construction. It features a star-shaped fountain and ceremonial flame surrounded by a grove of trees.“With this memorial we commemorate, for the first time, the two battles our disabled veterans have fought -- the battle over there, and the battle here at home -- your battle to recover, which at times can be even harder, and certainly as long,” Obama said. “You walk these quiet grounds -- pause by the pictures of these men and women, you look into their eyes, read their words -- and we’re somehow able to join them on a journey that speaks to the endurance of the American spirit.”The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

Jim Webb. (AP)Former Virginia Democratic Sen. Jim Webb on Sunday appeared closer to mounting a 2016 presidential campaign, criticizing decades of U.S. foreign policy and honing a domestic agenda, while also avoiding questions about whether he’d run as the anti-Hillary Clinton candidate.“We haven’t had a clear, articulate idea of what our foreign policy is since the Cold War,” Webb told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”The independent-minded Webb cited what he considers several foreign policy mistakes, including the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, which he and others argue created instability and a haven for Islamic militant groups, instead of ending the war on terror.Webb, whose hero is Ronald Reagan, also suggested that situation was made worse by the United States&apos; support of the so-called “Arab Spring,” which started in part with the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and spread to Libya and Syria.“We are at a crossroad as a nation on how we view ourselves,” he said.Webb has acknowledged being inspired by the recent populist movement, to which Americans have responded and that helped fellow Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Bill de Blasio get elected, as a Massachusetts senator and New York City mayor, respectively.And he made a visit last month to the early voting state of Iowa where he made about a dozen stops.On Sunday, Webb repeatedly declined to answer questions about whether he would be running directly against Clinton, the presumptive Democrat front-runner, who according to the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com leads all other potential Democratic candidates by a whopping 49 points.The 68-year-old Webb said he doesn’t see himself entering the race as an indictment on the policies or capabilities of Clinton, with whom he served in the Senate.He also declined to talk about whether he would try to run to the left of Clinton.“I’ll leave that up to other people,” Webb said. “I don’t know what she’s going to run on.”Still, he indicated that his domestic policy platform would in large part focus on economic inequality, arguing the recovery from the so-called Great Recession has been marked by stagnant wages yet massive gains on Wall Street, to which Clinton is often accused of being too close.Webb called the U.S. justice system an “embarrassment.”He also said he doesn’t see his views as coming from either the left or right and gave no timetable of a decision on whether he will run, saying he is considering a potential candidacy &quot;one day at a time.&quot;  "
"58","Pentagon official who headed Syria chemical weapons removal to help combat Ebola outbreak","FoxNews.com","2014-10-05 10:56:04","2014-10-06 15:20:01","http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/9neLdRceZDE/","politics","The Pentagon official who oversaw the successful effort to remove chemical weapons from Syria and Libya is leaving his post to help coordinate America’s and international efforts to contain the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa and prevent its spread within the U.S.Andrew C. Weber, the assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs for the past six years, is resigning to assist former ambassador Nancy Powell, whom President Barack Obama named earlier this month as the State Department’s coordinator for the anti-Ebola campaign. Weber declined requests for comment. But Administration officials who spoke on background said that Weber, who has served as Obama’s adviser at the Defense Department on non-proliferation issues, will serve as deputy to Powell.Administration officials hope that the addition of a skilled Defense Department veteran of politically sensitive and logistically complex chemical weapons removal projects will strengthen the Obama administration’s response to the epidemic which has swept through West Africa, infecting and killing thousands and devastating their national economies. Many public health experts say that efforts so far to contain the virus have been hampered by poor outreach to and coordination among governments and international relief groups.Weber’s appointment is one of several steps that Obama and his team have quietly authorized to boost the effectiveness of America’s response to the epidemic. The World Health Organization estimates that Ebola, which normally kills about over 50 percent of infected humans, has already infected some 7,400 people and killed about 3,400, mainly in West Africa.On Friday, senior public health and emergency preparedness officials outlined some of the steps being taken to stop the spread of the epidemic, the deadliest in recent history. But in addition, the White House has quietly approved and taken other steps – such as Weber’s job shift -- to improve Washington’s response to the outbreak, limit its devastating effects, and prevent its spread to and within the U.S..For one, officials said, the administration has involved the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, the Pentagon’s top bio-defense lab and a crucial source of expertise on Ebola and other lethal pathogens. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that the RIID, as it is known, has sent several experts to Africa. Officials said that the institute, which has worked in the region on Lassa fever and other dangerous hemorrhagic killers since 2006, has already begun operating a small research lab in Liberia. The administration has also authorized the Navy to open two labs in West Africa, one of which began operating last week in Liberia.In his Pentagon job, Weber oversaw the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which has also been monitoring Ebola. DTRA helped develop ZMapp, the experimental Ebola treatment which was given to two American public health workers who contracted the virus while working in Africa and survived. Two other vaccines are also in early stages of testing.Critics have charged that American and international public health authorities were too slow in responding to the epidemic, which is believed to have begun in Guinea late last year.In mid-September, Obama declared the Ebola outbreak a “national security priority,” saying the world has a “responsibility to act&quot; to contain the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. He said that the U.S. would devote substantial resources -- precisely how much the White House has not said -- to stopping the spread of the disease. Obama noted that the epidemic would “get worse before it gets better.” He also announced that the U.S. military would lead the effort -- called Operation United Assistance -- and ordered the deployment of over 3,000 U.S. soldiers to build high-containment labs and treatment centers for those infected. An army spokesman said Friday that the total might rise to 4,000, depending on conditions on the ground. Ambassador Powell left her ambassadorial post in India in March following a dispute between Washington and New Delhi over the arrest of a junior Indian diplomat in New York. Powell, who has held several key posts in Asia, too, has experience in combating disease outbreaks. She previously served as the State Department’s avian flu coordinator.The World Health Organization has been widely criticized for its slow response to the epidemic. Although the first Ebola cases emerged in late 2013 in Guinea, the agency, beset by budget cuts and a loss of veteran experts, did not declare an outbreak until March, when it warned that 49 cases had been confirmed, along with 29 deaths. It did not declare an international public health emergency until August.Concerned about the possible spread of the deadly virus to the U.S., Obama became personally involved this summer, officials said. On Friday, the White House announced that he had gotten an update on the epidemic from Gen. David Rodriguez, the commander of U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), with whom he spoke by phone. The military’s Joint Force Command began deploying the first of some 3,200 soldiers to West Africa in mid-September to build the field hospitals and mobile treatment centers, but that effort, too, has gone slowly.Judith Miller, a Fox News contributor, is an award-winning writer and author.

He was mistakenly sent home, despite revealing he was visiting from Liberia, before returning by ambulance days later.Ten of the 50 people being monitored for Ebola are considered high risk. Among them are four people who came in close contact with Duncan.Fauci was highly skeptical about the argument that the contagious virus, transmitted through direct contact with a victim’s bodily fluids, could be brought across the southern U.S. border, which illegal immigrants have routinely crossed over for years without detection.“I wouldn’t be worried about an illegal immigrant coming across the border,” he told Fox News.Fauci also downplayed the threat the virus could be used as a bio-terror weapon.“That would be ineffective,” he said.Also Sunday, officials said a homeless man being sought because of possible contact with Duncan was found in Texas after several hours of searching. The person is not considered to be one of the 10 people who definitely had contact with Duncan. However, he is part of a larger group of 38 people who may have been around Duncan when he was showing symptoms of the disease, officials said.He was found a few hours after officials on Sunday morning announced he was missing, Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed said.Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins called the man, whom he didn&apos;t identify, a &quot;low-risk individual.&quot; Authorities had monitored him a day earlier but want to take his temperature regularly to make sure he doesn&apos;t have a fever, a possible symptom of Ebola infection.Jenkins said the man would receive a mental health evaluation at Dallas&apos; Parkland Hospital. The man will eventually be placed in housing that give allow health workers direct access to him daily. Syed said it was unlikely that the man would be placed in a homeless shelter.Meanwhile, Fauci&apos;s appeared to remain opposed to closing U.S. points of entry to travellers from the Western Africa countries hit by the Ebola, saying such a move would impede the &quot;in and out&quot; of supplies and personnel, with the potential to unravel those governments.However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden on Sunday made clear he was open to any reasonable suggestion that could help swiftly resolve the international health crisis.He told ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; that he&apos;s open to any &quot;workable&quot; suggestion that &quot;won&apos;t backfire&quot; or increase the risk of infection.The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

In fact, over 50 percent of cases will require carpal tunnel release surgery.When swelling occurs within the enclosed area of the wrist, pressure on the median nerve may cause numbness, tingling and weakness of the affected hand.  At the roof of the carpal tunnel— a narrow, rigid passageway of ligament and bones at the base of the hand— a band of tissue called the transverse ligament is cut to release this pressure and relieve a patient’s symptoms. The most common surgery is an open procedure, in which the surgeon makes an incision from the palm to the wrist, then underlying tissues are dissected to cut the transverse carpal ligament, creating more room for the median nerve.A newer, minimally invasive procedure is also an option.  Tiny keyhole incisions are made for instruments to reach and cut the transverse carpal ligament. Patients have a shorter and less painful recovery period with this endoscopic surgery.The endoscopic surgery takes between 30 and 90 minutes to perform, and is done as an outpatient procedure.If you&apos;re a risk for carpal tunnel syndrome and want to avoid surgery, try using ergonomic aids like wrist braces or typing pads. Take breaks to reduce irritation, and when possible avoid repetitive wrist motion."

At first, everything seemed normal as she started to have contractions. About 10 hours later she was given a second dose. Her contractions were coming much faster and now she had a sharp pain in her left side. “It went on and on, and I just kept saying, ‘Please, this pain doesn’t feel right.’”“Two hours later, they finally listened and it was too late,” she said.Her uterus had hyper-stimulated and tore top to bottom, front and the back. She was bleeding out and her daughter Meah was dead.“I awoke to all my family members around me. They put her in my arms and she was perfect. Everybody was crying and they said we’re so sorry she’s gone.”Induction methodsWhen labor doesn’t start naturally, there are many methods providers can use to get labor going. According to the Listening to Mothers Survey III, 30 percent of women had medically-induced labors between 2011 and 2012.Pitocin, the synthetic version of the hormone oxytocin that a woman’s body produces to start uterine contractions, is the method most women think of. It’s given through an IV and dosage can be adjusted. Pitocin works best when the cervix is favorable—meaning it’s dilated, effaced (soft), and in an anterior position.  Some women worry that Pitocin could put stress on their babies, but it depends on how aggressively it’s given.“There are a lot of ways that you can control it so it doesn’t stress the baby out,” said Dr. David Ghausi, an OB/GYN at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, Calif.There’s also a concern that Pitocin makes contractions very strong but it varies from woman to woman and could also be the case with natural labor, he said.Another induction procedure is artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), which might help, although Pitocin is often given as well.“If you break someone’s water in the hospital, it’s not a guarantee that you’re going to go into labor in the next hour or two hours,” Ghausi said.Prostaglandin medications like Cytotec and Cervidil help to soften the cervix and in some women, it may also cause contractions. These medications may not work if the baby is preterm and if the cervix is not favorable. Unlike Cervidil, which can be removed if the uterus hyper-stimulates or the contractions are too close together, Cytotec dissolves in the body.Providers can also insert a Foley catheter balloon filled with sterile water into the cervix to mechanically dilate it and cause a release of prostaglandins. Providers can also “strip the membranes,” by inserting a finger through the cervix and moving it side to side to release prostaglandins. This procedure can be painful and there’s no guarantee with either method that labor will start.  When is induction necessary?For women with certain medical conditions like high blood pressure, preeclampsia, uncontrolled diabetes or placental abruption, induction is necessary for their health and the health of the babies. Another medical indication for induction is if the baby is not growing at a normal rate.Experts agree physicians may also persuade women to be induced because their babies are measuring large, even though ultrasounds can have a margin of error up to 20 percent. In fact, women whose providers expressed concern about their baby’s size had babies whose weight on average 7 pounds, 15 ounces, according to the Listening to Mothers survey.Some providers may also follow the rule “41 and done,” while others may wait longer.  Induction risksAs with any medical procedure, induction comes with risks. For starters, if a woman’s cervix is unfavorable, the risk of having a cesarean is 30 percent. If the cervix is favorable, the risk is the same as natural childbirth, Ghausi said.Elective inductions before 39 weeks could pose problems for babies whose lungs are not fully mature. Other risks include fetal distress, infection for both mom and baby, umbilical cord problems, uterine rupture and hemorrhage. What’s more, a recent study out of Beth Israel Medical Center found that induction with Pitocin increased the risk that newborns would be unexpectedly admitted into the NICU and have lower Apgar scores.   Even though induction is meant to jump-start labor, it doesn’t necessarily speed it up. “You could be in the hospital 24, 36,  or 48 hours before you have the baby,” Ghausi said.    Induction rates are on the decline, but still cause for concern.“So you want to have the baby today?” Kerrie Hopkins of New York remembers her doctor asking during a prenatal visit on her due date, more than 10 years ago.  Hopkins arrived at the hospital and was quickly set up with Pitocin.“The nurses said, ‘Wow, this doctor wants you to have this baby on his lunch hour,’” she said.And sure enough, within two hours of her doctor’s appointment she gave birth. Since she had waited past her due date and had 17 hours of labor with her first child, Hopkins was grateful to have been induced.“Anything to avoid pain—it was fabulous,” she said.For other women, having an elective induction may not be medically necessary but their reasons may be equally as compelling.Danielle Rothweiler of Shawnee, Pennsylvania had her water broken two days before her due date. She had two herniated discs and problems with her sciatica, which became worse during pregnancy. She had intense pain, used crutches to get around and couldn’t walk up the stairs.“I just could not deal with the pain anymore,” she said. “I knew [from the doctor telling me] that the baby was going to be healthy so I knew it was important to get out of pain.”After almost 20 years of induction rates on the rise, they are slowly declining.  In 2012, 23.3 percent of women had induction, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Elective inductions before 39 weeks have also declined, from 17 percent in 2010 to 4.6 percent in 2013, according to a survey by the Leapfrog Group.Last year, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine released new recommendations against induction before 39 weeks without a medical reason. A few weeks ago, the Association of Women&apos;s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses got on board by issuing the same guidelines.“In my opinion, we need to do more. Forty weeks is just an estimated due date,” according to Dr. Michelle Collins, a certified nurse-midwife and director of the nurse-midwifery program at Vanderbilt University School of Nursing in Nashville, Tenn. Collins said the research shows that if women are not induced, most will go into labor at 41 weeks and one day.What’s more, during natural labor, the baby’s brain sends a message to the placenta and the mother’s brain that it’s go time.“It’s a very complicated biochemical process that has to happen and so when we bypass all of that and play Mother Nature, it doesn’t work so well,” Collins said.Although most hospitals have policies against induction before 39 weeks without a medical indication, experts agree that some physicians still push for it and many women request it as well.“If you sit down and discuss with them the risks and the benefits of waiting, all patients are fine with it,” Ghausi said.As with any decision about pregnancy and childbirth, women should arm themselves with relevant information, advocates and supportive providers, and who will help them make the best choices for their families.“The most important thing is to find a physician who will listen to them and who will be receptive to their wishes in labor,” Ghausi said. “There should be a dialogue between the patient and physician as to the reasons why and the risks and the benefits.”Julie Revelant is a freelance writer and copywriter specializing in parenting, health, healthcare, nutrition, food and women&apos;s issues.

In fact, a study from the University of Massachusetts showed that 60 percent of individuals self-reported that they could not make it through a 10-minute conversation without lying at least once.And men are the worst culprits: British research found that men lie twice as much as women. While your pants won’t necessarily catch on fire, more trouble comes with lying than you may have originally thought--especially when it comes to your health. Read on to learn the many ways that harboring secrets can harm your well-being.Stress Will Eat at YouLies tend to breed more lies, and the act of coming up with new stories to cover up small falsehoods can get exhausting and stressful. Need concrete proof? Just look to the tools law enforcement officials use to catch them: lie detector tests.Polygraph machines can sense changes in the hormones called glucocorticoids, which help spur chemical reactions in your body like changes in your pulse and breath, skin electricity (a moisture buildup under skin that makes you more conductive), or even the pitch of your voice, says David Ropeik, a communications instructor at Harvard University. The more revved those hormones are, the more signs you&apos;re likely to give off.And the longer you attempt to keep a story straight, the more strain and stress you’ll feel. This discomfort can lead to more serious side effects down the line. Columbia University research shows stressed-out people were 27 percent more likely to have heart attacks compared to those who worried less. (Tame your tension with these 6 Ways to Calm the Heck Down.)Workouts Will Feel HarderDeception might keep you from dragging your butt to the gym. Stanford researchers had participants write down big secrets they were keeping that required lies to cover up. Some lies were big--like cheating on a spouse--while others were minor falsehoods like pretending you’re feeling fine when you’ve had a rough day.Acknowledging the dishonesty made physical tasks such as carrying groceries or helping someone move feel more taxing, and even hills and distances seemed steeper and farther, the self-reported research showed. What’s more, the bigger the secret, the more “weighed down” people felt.How does that work? These thoughts may activate parts of your brain tied to perception and vision in the same way as when you are physically weighed down, study authors said. This can lead to physical overexertion, exhaustion, and stress. So the heavier the lie you’re dealing with, the heavier those bench presses may feel. (Learn how to spots Where Stress Hides in your body and how to fight back.)Your Health and Relationships Will SufferCut out falsehoods, solve all the health problems? Notre Dame researchers monitored the lies of more than 100 people by subjecting them to weekly lie detector tests. Scientists instructed half of the study participants not to tell blatant lies by giving them tips on how to avoid a falsehood. (They didn’t have to be completely honest; they were allowed to dodge questions or keep secrets.)However, those who were explicitly told to tell the truth during the study period reported fibbing less frequently, and in the end they reported having improved relationships, better sleep, less tension, and fewer headaches and sore throats.

He has a cough and conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, hospital officials said.Sacra will remain in isolation until doctors have confirmation from tests by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that he is not infected with the virus, the hospital said.

The hospital previously said Duncan was being kept in isolation and that his condition was serious but stable.Duncan traveled from disease-ravaged Liberia to Dallas last month before he began showing symptoms of the disease.Meanwhile, the woman who calls Duncan her stepfather told The Wall Street Journal that he got much sicker shortly after he was diagnosed with a fever and sent home.Younger Jallah told the Wall Street Journal she now fears for her own health. She is also worried that her children may have been exposed to the deadly disease when they went with her to her mother&apos;s Texas apartment to see Duncan.Jallah is a 35-year-old nurse&apos;s aide and the daughter of Louise Troh, Duncan’s girlfriend. He traveled from Ebola-racked Liberia to visit Troh on Sept. 21. Troh and Duncan met in West Africa. They have a college-age son.Jallah told the Associated Press Friday that she is wracked with regret she did not take greater precautions in her dealings with Duncan. She also said she is not kissing or hugging her children, ages, 2,4 and 6 or her partner’s 11-year-old son, or sharing dishes with him.Health officials have told Jallah to keep her family at home. But unlike at her mother&apos;s apartment, there were not armed guards in front to prevent them from leaving.Health officials also said Saturday that they are monitoring about 50 people for signs of the deadly disease who may have had contact with Duncan, including nine who are believed to be at a higher risk. Thus far none have shown symptoms. Among those being monitored are people who rode in the ambulance that transported Duncan back to the hospital before his diagnosis, said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.On Friday, a hazardous-materials crew decontaminated the Dallas apartment where Duncan was staying when he got sick during his visit. The materials were sealed in industrial barrels that were to be stored in trucks until they can be hauled away for permanent disposal.The family was moved to a private home in a gated community, where they are being carefully monitored.The first Ebola diagnosis in the U.S. has raised concerns about whether the disease that has killed 3,400 people in West Africa could spread in the U.S. Federal health officials say they are confident they can keep it in check.The virus that causes Ebola is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids -- blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen -- of an infected person who is showing symptoms.The hospital issued a news release late Friday saying that the doctor who initially treated Duncan did have access to his travel history, after all. It had said Thursday that a flaw in the electronic health records systems led to separate physician and nursing workflows, and that the doctor hadn&apos;t had access to Duncan&apos;s travel history.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

But just because those temperatures are dropping doesn’t mean your activity level has to. Instead of letting your body go into an exercise hiatus (leading straight to a holiday food binge), take some time to game plan your fall routine. Before you blink, it will be New Year’s Eve again and you’ll be vowing to get back to the summer body you might have had all along. So, don’t stop now! Be proactive and use these 7 ideas to help keep you from “fall”ing off the workout wagon in the months ahead.Keep your summer wardrobeWe all need a little motivation to keep us going. The best way to accomplish that in the fall is to keep that summer wardrobe for as long as possible. When the weather does start to cool off, try to avoid baggy clothing and too many unnecessary layers. Instead stick to tighter, more form fitted clothing. If you (and other people) can see your shape on a regular basis you’ll be more inclined to maintain it. Also, treat yourself to new gear when you’re feeling good. When you reward yourself, your brain will associate your hard work with positive reinforcement. So, go ahead and splurge on those yoga pants you’ve been eyeing (and then go to yoga!).RELATED: Lose 10 Inches in 10 Days Sign up for a Mud RunNeed a little healthy competition in your life? Like mud? Sign up for a mud run or obstacle course in your area. Signing up means setting a goal and committing to it. It’s harder to back out when you have a date set on the calendar and people counting on you to be there. Also, it’s a great way to show yourself how strong you are. Mudderella is all about that–taking pride in your personal strength and only looking to improve by your own standards. It is female empowerment to the max and one of those milestones that will push you to be better and motivate you to keep going even after it’s over. It’s about staying healthy, challenging yourself, and getting your hands ‘a little’ dirty every once in a while. Visit Mudderella.com for more info.RELATED: 10 Weight Loss Mistakes Everyone Makes Get schooledOnce the kids go back to school, it can be harder to find the time to work out between drop offs and soccer practice, etc. On those days, instead of opting out of your workout altogether, try fitting in at least some sort of physical activity. Walk or ride bikes with your kids to school instead of driving them if you live within walking distance. Stay a few minutes after practice to play catch one night. No, it’s not going to be the most intense workout of your life. But we’re talking about maintenance here, people; something is still better than nothing, always! Don’t throw away the whole day just because you can’t get to the gym or a class. It’s a lifestyle.RELATED: 18 Habits of the Happiest Families Try a Turkey TrotThe average American will consume about 3,000 calories during their Thanksgiving feast (give or take a piece of grandma’s pumpkin pie). To avoid the post-turkey dinner regret, sign up for a local ‘turkey trot’ race and get that metabolism fired up before the bird even goes into the oven. Also, most of them are put on by local or national charities that provide needy families with Thanksgiving meals. What could be more rewarding both physically and emotionally than donating to a good cause while simultaneously burning 600+ calories dressed in a turkey hat? The answer is nothing. Check online to find a turkey trot near you.Download a new workout appFor those who live in places where seasons are a factor (i.e. everywhere but Southern California), you might need to get a little more creative with your workout routine. Don’t let staying inside be an excuse to skimp on your workout. There are plenty of fitness apps to choose from that allow you to customize your workout to your specific needs. By keeping track of your workouts, they bring the accountability of a trainer to the comfort of your own living room. Plus, because our smart phones are always close by, you have no excuse not to fit it in, no matter where you are. I like the “Hot 5” app because they’re quick five-minute workout bursts that can be used to add on to your own workout or as your entire fitness regime. From beginner to expert, there’s something for everyone. Plus, they’re only five minutes. And who doesn’t have that?Get creative at the pumpkin patchGo beyond just the picking. Aside from all the obvious walking/running around the field with the kids, a pumpkin patch is a great place to try out your fitness creativity. For example, grab a small to medium sized pumpkin and use it like a kettlebell to perform some “pumpkin swings.” Or, while walking through a corn maze or trail, wander over to a hay bale and do some step ups to get that heart rate up. Try doing as many as you can for one minute, rest, and then repeat. Happy hunting!RELATED: 17 Delicious Pumpkin Recipes Join a sports teamSince when did joining a sports team become an activity only for kids? Why not join an adult softball or kickball league in your area? Do it alone, or with a friend/spouse. Either way, it’s a great way to meet other people with similar interests while simultaneously keeping your body guessing by introducing it to something new. The gym can get so mundane sometimes; don’t get caught up in the same routine. Plus, life shouldn’t be lived only inside. So, go out and enjoy!This article originally appeared on Health.com. "

He said Argentina&apos;s foreign ministry and customs agency were working on recovering the cars.The &quot;Top Gear&quot; crew was using three cars, one of them a Porsche bearing the license plate &quot;H982 FKL,&quot; which some Argentines believed was a reference to the brief but bloody 1982 war in which their country tried and failed to take the islands from Britain.&quot;The feeling over Malvinas is still very strong here,&quot; said Oscar Heredia, a spokesman for the town of Tolhuin, using the Argentine name for the islands known in English as the Falklands. &quot;The license plate was taken as a provocation.&quot;The provincial city of Ushuaia, on the tip of Tierra del Fuego, is the closest spot in Argentine territory to the South Atlantic archipelago and many military contingents were deployed from the town.This week, a group of former Argentine war combatants held a protest in front of the hotel where Clarkson and the BBC crew were staying.The British newspaper The Telegraph said the BBC denied the license plate was chosen intentionally. &quot;Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme; to suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate, or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original is completely untrue,&quot; BBC executive producer Andy Wilman was quoted as saying.In 2011, the BBC apologized to Mexico over remarks made on &quot;Top Gear&quot; that characterized Mexicans as lazy and oafish.+ FollowFOX411 on Facebook"
"80","Waylon Jennings items up for auction in Phoenix","Associated Press","2014-10-05 07:53:04","2014-10-06 15:20:21","http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/entertainment/~3/fcTVFxbxtvQ/","entertainment","Aug. 1999. Waylon Jennings poses in Nashville, Tenn. (The Associated Press)Outlaw country singer Waylon Jennings owned a vintage motorcycle that had previously belonged to his close friend, rock &apos;n&apos; roll star Buddy Holly.Jennings was supposed to have been with Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson when the crooners were killed in a 1959 small-plane crash that became known as &quot;the Day the Music Died.&quot;Two decades later, members of Holly&apos;s band, the Crickets, tracked down the red Ariel Cyclone and gave it to Jennings as a birthday gift that he kept in his living room until he died in 2002.The bike is among thousands of items that Jennings&apos; estate is putting on the auction block Sunday online and at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix.Jennings, known for his black cowboy hat, recorded 16 No. 1 country singles over his decades-long career. His hits include the theme from &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard,&quot; a television show that he also narrated, and the Willie Nelson duet &quot;Mammas Don&apos;t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys.&quot;Something literally connected to Nelson also will be up for sale: his braids.The signature locks were presented in 1983 as a gift to celebrate Jennings&apos; sobriety at a party thrown by Johnny Cash, said Arlan Ettinger, co-founder of Guernsey&apos;s, the New York City-based auction house running the sale.Jennings teamed with Nelson, Cash and Kris Kristofferson to form the country super group, the Highwaymen. Their original contract, signed by all four members, is also up for sale.Ettinger wouldn&apos;t estimate how much the items would go for.&quot;It&apos;s very hard to say, particularly when something is made valuable by virtue of its history,&quot; Ettinger said. But the motorcycle, &quot;I certainly think it&apos;s going to bring hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot;Jennings&apos; widow, singer Jessi Colter, who lives in Arizona, provided the items for sale, which also include guitars, handwritten song lyrics, a letter signed by John Lennon and a boxing robe worn by Muhammad Ali, Ettinger said.The singer lived in suburban Phoenix when he died in 2002 at age 64 of diabetes-related health problems.Ettinger said he had considered holding the auction in the country music capital of Nashville, Tennessee, but Colter said her husband loved Arizona more than most places.&quot;He felt most at home here,&quot; Ettinger said.Some auction proceeds will benefit Phoenix Children&apos;s Hospital per Colter&apos;s wishes, Ettinger said.+ FollowFOX411 on Facebook"
